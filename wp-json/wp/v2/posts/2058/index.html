The house belonged to Mykola Udianskyi. Mytrov was extradited to Ukraine later that year, in December 2019. At the time, he was hiding from authorities due to his suspected involvement in a series of contract killings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leonid Mytrov, now 42, is the leader of the organized crime group \u201cZalyutynski,\u201d named after the Zalyutine neighborhood of Kharkiv. Since 2015, the gang was part of a larger criminal structure led by Vadym Kazartsev, also known as \u201cKniaz\u201d (\u201cThe Prince\u201d), which specialized in contract killings, raids, robbery, and extortion across eastern Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"552\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744682_vadym_kazarcev_knyaz-552x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"A middle-aged man sits at a table wearing an expensive watch\" class=\"wp-image-1702\" style=\"width:388px;height:auto\" title=\"A middle-aged man sits at a table wearing an expensive watch\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744682_vadym_kazarcev_knyaz-552x1024.jpeg 552w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744682_vadym_kazarcev_knyaz-162x300.jpeg 162w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744682_vadym_kazarcev_knyaz.jpeg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Vadym Kazartsev (\u201cKniaz\u201d)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, for example, members of Kniaz\u2019s gang \u2014 including Oleksandr Poliakov, Perviz Hubert Ogly Ismailov, and Oleksii Kobylnytskyi \u2014 attacked construction company director Yurii Omelianenko and forced him to hand over control of his business, TOV \u201cBudivelnyk,\u201d to Kobylnytskyi. The gang planned to use the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/who-lives-in-taryan-towers-how-owners-of-ukraines-most-expensive-apartments-launder-their-dirty-money\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">to launder money from illegal operations<\/a>. According to police reports, they later used this company \u2014 in collusion with officials from \u201cSkhidbudtranshaz\u201d and the state-owned company \u201cUkrgazvydobuvannia\u201d \u2014 to steal over 50 million UAH in 2020 via fictitious business transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kazartsev\u2019s group was also <a href=\"https:\/\/apostrophe.ua\/article\/society\/2020-08-25\/reyderskoe-knyajestvo-chem-izvesten-kriminalnyiy-avtoritet-knyaz-chyu-gruppirovku-nedavno-zaderjala-sbu\/34597\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">implicated<\/a> in the murder of Yurii Diment, a business partner of Kharkiv mayor Hennadii Kernes, as well as in the killing of Volodymyr Borokh, a key witness in the 2017 murder of former russian State Duma deputy Denis Voronenkov.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voronenkov was <a href=\"https:\/\/babel.ua\/ru\/news\/68115-ubiystvo-eks-deputata-gosdumy-voronenkova-sud-zavershil-sledstvie-i-pereshel-k-debatam\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">shot<\/a> in central Kyiv in March 2017. The suspected gunman was Ukrainian citizen Pavlo Parshov, while the alleged mastermind was russian crime boss Volodymyr Tyurin. After Voronenkov\u2019s assassination, Yurii Vasylenko \u2014 another criminal figure linked to Tyurin \u2014 decided to push Kniaz\u2019s group out of Kharkiv. Allegedly, Tyurin had promised to help Vasylenko take control of the city\u2019s criminal scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, Kazartsev launched a violent campaign against his rivals. In November 2017, a member of his gang named Titov shot and killed Eduard \u201cLipa\u201d Akselrod outside his home. In October 2018, Vladyslav \u201cMammoth\u201d Bezruk survived an assassination attempt after being tracked by Leonid Mytrov in person. And in January 2019, Kniaz\u2019s men attacked Oleksii Lohvynenko, head of Kharkiv\u2019s Criminal Investigation Department, who had been working against local organized crime. That same month, Vasylenko was abducted at gunpoint in moscow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, Mytrov was placed on a wanted list and fled to Montenegro, where he lived in Udianskyi\u2019s home. Although he was eventually captured and returned to Ukraine, he managed to avoid all legal consequences. <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">According to BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Kazartsev paid $400,000 to an official in Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to make the charges against Mytrov disappear. As a result, all criminal cases were closed by February 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By May 2020, Mytrov was back in Kharkiv \u2014 attending Mykola Udianskyi\u2019s birthday party. Several other members of the Zalyutynski gang were also present. Later that year, on November 29, Mytrov celebrated his own birthday in Dubai \u2014 hosted once again by his friend Udianskyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their relationship was clearly close. In September 2019, Udianskyi\u2019s wife Yana issued a power of attorney to Mytrov\u2019s parents \u2014 Kateryna and Valerii Mytrov \u2014 giving them control over a Toyota Land Cruiser 200 with license plate AX00****.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"764\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii-1024x764.png\" alt=\"Four muscular men sit at a table\" class=\"wp-image-1703\" style=\"width:690px;height:auto\" title=\"Four muscular men sit at a table\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii-1024x764.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii-768x573.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii-1536x1147.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleanedleonid_mitrov_mykola_udyanskii.png 1546w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Mykola Udianskyi (far right) and Leonid Mytrov (far left)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2019, police opened a criminal case (No. 12019220500001856) into the murder of Volodymyr Viktorovych Borokh.

The case named both Leonid Mytrov and his close friend Mykola Udianskyi as persons of interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same month, Vadym Kazartsev died in a German clinic after battling cancer. Several crime figures \u2014 including Leonid Mytrov \u2014 tried to fill the power vacuum in Kharkiv\u2019s underworld.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 14, 2021, Kharkiv police <a href=\"https:\/\/zn.ua\/UKRAINE\/trebovali-u-fermera-700-tysjach-dollarov-v-kharkove-zaderzhali-bandu-vymohatelej.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">arrested<\/a> several members of the Zalyutynski group for extorting $700,000 from a local farming executive.

According to BlackBox OSINT, Mykola Udianskyi continued to visit Montenegro in between trips to Ukraine and the UAE. In May 2021, Udianskyi threw another birthday party \u2014 this time in the Emirates \u2014 and Mytrov flew in from Montenegro to attend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"635\" height=\"631\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744664_den_narodjennya_udyanskogo_v_oae.png\" alt=\"A group of men relaxing on a yacht\" class=\"wp-image-1704\" title=\"A group of men relaxing on a yacht\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744664_den_narodjennya_udyanskogo_v_oae.png 635w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744664_den_narodjennya_udyanskogo_v_oae-300x298.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1745744664_den_narodjennya_udyanskogo_v_oae-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Mykola Udianskyi (center) celebrates his birthday in Dubai with members of the Zalyutynski crime group<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kr2\"><strong>Which Other Members of the \u201cZalyutynski\u201d Crime Group Are Linked to Consul Udianskyi<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At that same birthday party in May 2021, another guest was Oleg Shyriaiev. A month later, in June, Udianskyi was seen with him at the Dubrovskyi restaurant in Kharkiv. Shyriaiev, known by the nickname \u201cShyrkin,\u201d is the founder of a group called Eastern Corps. A few years ago, he had a falling-out with Ukraine\u2019s National Corps and switched sides \u2014 joining Kniaz\u2019s gang, where he took part in business raids and used violence to settle conflicts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shyriaiev is also known to have had close ties with Ilya Kyva, a former MP from the now-banned Opposition Platform \u2013 For Life party. He was involved in Kyva\u2019s public organization \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/c\/43668328\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Patriots for Life<\/a>\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another friend of the honorary consul who is currently in custody is Yurii Poltavskyi. He has direct links to Mytrov and has been repeatedly charged with robbery, drug distribution, and assault. He is currently being held in the Kharkiv pre-trial detention center. We also mentioned him in <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/a-fraudster-with-a-diplomatic-passport-how-romanias-honorary-consul-in-kharkiv-mykola-udianskyi-made-a-fortune-on-crypto-scams-part-1\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">Part 1 of our investigation<\/a> \u2014 he was the man to whom Udianskyi transferred ownership of his company \u201cYedinarcoin\u201d after the E-Dinar Coin project collapsed. In short, Poltavskyi was a frontman for Udianskyi and received financial support from him while he was free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another of Udianskyi\u2019s associates being held in the same Kharkiv detention center is Dmytro Oleksandrenko, known as \u201cKaban\u201d. He\u2019s a member of the Zalyutynski group and was one of the five arrested in April 2021 for extorting money from the agricultural businessman. According to our sources, Oleksandrenko had helped Udianskyi on several occasions while he was not in custody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still on the wanted list since September 20, 2021, is Pavlo Solopov \u2014 nicknamed \u201cPasha America\u201d. He\u2019s Leonid Mytrov\u2019s godson and a member of the same criminal gang. He had previously been charged with both violent and financial crimes and is reportedly on good terms with Udianskyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another figure linked to both Mytrov and Udianskyi is Oleksandr Halkin, a convicted member of the Zalyutynski group known in the underworld as \u201cTiulia\u201d. <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">According to BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, he, like Mytrov, lived at Udianskyi\u2019s house in Montenegro for a while. In October 2021, Tiulia stabbed an officer from Ukraine\u2019s Strategic Investigations Department during an incident at the Bolero nightclub in Kharkiv.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s Dmytro Shapovalov \u2014 known as \u201cHuliver\u201d \u2014 who has a particularly close connection with the consul. On November 1, 2020, at around 5:49 a.m., he killed a man named Ruslan Smyrnov during a fight at the Biani restaurant. Shapovalov was not alone \u2014 he was with other members of the Zalyutynski group, including Pavlo Solopov and Dmytro Oleksandrenko. After the killing, Shapovalov took the blame, and the others went into hiding. But none of them faced consequences \u2014 according to BlackBox OSINT, Mykola Udianskyi paid a large sum of money to \u201cresolve\u201d the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months after Shapovalov\u2019s arrest, Udianskyi helped get him out of detention. The court changed his status to house arrest, and later to night-only curfew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Udianskyi is also reportedly acquainted \u2014 through Mytrov \u2014 with one of the most powerful criminal bosses in Ukraine, Serhii Lysenko, known as \u201cLiora Sumskyi\u201d. Lysenko currently lives in Turkey, and according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Udianskyi has visited him there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/04\\\/cleanedred-udyan.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1705&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:3776,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: Who in the criminal world is connected to Romania\\u2019s honorary consul in Kharkiv, Mykola Udianskyi.

In the past, Udianskyi freely posted photos with Chechen men, including fighters from the Akhmat fight club \u2014 which is owned by kadyrov himself.

He was suspected of robbing and kidnapping a Ukrainian citizen, Ihor Yermakov. According to reports, Yermakov had been beaten and tortured by a group of russian men who forced him to transfer $200,000 worth of cryptocurrency to their wallet. One of them was Askhabov \u2014 the same man who, in 2023, had already been detained in Thailand along with his brother, Khusein Askhabov, for kidnapping, torturing, and robbing an Italian citizen. In both cases, the brothers escaped prosecution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s likely that the photo of Hasan Askhabov with crypto businessman Mykola Udianskyi was taken on the island of Bali \u2014 where Udianskyi had lived for a long time, and where Askhabov and his gang abducted the Ukrainian victim and stole his crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With ties like these \u2014 to known criminals, violent offenders, and men from kadyrov\u2019s inner circle \u2014 it raises a question: how did Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Mykola Udianskyi as Romania\u2019s honorary consul in Kharkiv?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the answer, every day that he continues to hold this diplomatic title raises more questions about the kind of people who are being handed diplomatic passports in Ukraine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the first part of our investigation into Mykola Udianskyi, the honorary consul of Romania in Kharkiv, we detailed his &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":1714,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[21],"tags":[2527,2531,2529,935,2533,2535,2538,2525],"class_list":["post-2058","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-main-en","tag-akhmat-club","tag-criminal-investigation-department-of-ukraines-national-police","tag-hasan-askhabov","tag-kharkiv","tag-leonid-mytrov","tag-liora-sumskyi","tag-shapovalov-dmytro","tag-udianskyi-mykola"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>A Friend of Kharkiv Gangsters: The Criminal Past of Romania\u2019s Honorary Consul Mykola Udianskyi.

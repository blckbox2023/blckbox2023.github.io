With each investigation we publish, we\u2019re less and less surprised to see that full-scale war is not only a time when millions lose their homes, property and even their lives, but also a time when some people spend millions\u2026 of US dollars on luxury living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/vladyslav-myroshnychenko-how-a-hookah-specialist-from-kharkiv-became-a-crypto-expert-and-a-dollar-millionaire-evading-taxes\/\" data-wpel-link=\"advanced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" title=\"\">our investigation about 26-year-old Vladyslav Myroshnychenko<\/a>, a hookah server and bartender from Kharkiv who suddenly became a dollar millionaire during the war and ignores taxes, we mentioned his friends and business partners. As it turns out, Myroshnychenko isn\u2019t the only one making huge profits during russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. His friends Mykhailo Uvarov and Yevhen Trusov are also doing well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru1\"><strong>How fraudster and abuser Mykhailo Uvarov got rich during the war<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>40-year-old Kharkiv resident <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/uvarov_m_n\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Mykhailo Uvarov<\/a>, known as \u201cThe Frenchman,\u201d makes his money, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, through illegal call center operations that scam people over the phone. But he\u2019s also well known for his long list of legal troubles. He\u2019s been a suspect and wanted for serious crimes, implicated in large-scale theft, car robberies, and even an attack on police officers who tried to detain him. Uvarov has also appeared in numerous administrative and civil cases, including domestic violence charges filed by his wife, Kateryna Yevtushenko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2022, Kateryna <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/truexanewsua\/22335\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">posted<\/a> videos on social media saying she\u2019d been trying to escape Uvarov for five years. She said he regularly threatened to kill or cripple her. He was detained, but, as often happens in Ukraine, released shortly afterward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Uvarov still hasn\u2019t faced any consequences. He continues to live carefree, driving luxury cars, living in premium homes, and traveling abroad freely \u2014 even under martial law. And the most outrageous part? Uvarov now shows up in the news not as a criminal but as a \u201cphilanthropist\u201d and a sports official. On January 20, 2025, he was named honorary head of the Kyiv Regional Branch of the <a href=\"https:\/\/noc-ukr.org\/news\/25619\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">National Olympic Committee<\/a> of Ukraine. Makes you wonder, how much does a title like that cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"908\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172369_mykhailo_uvarov_nok-1024x908.png\" alt=\"Mykhailo Uvarov, wearing a black cap and shirt, speaks at a podium and shakes hands with a man in a light blue shirt\n\" class=\"wp-image-1775\" style=\"width:642px;height:auto\" title=\"Mykhailo Uvarov, wearing a black cap and shirt, speaks at a podium and shakes hands with a man in a light blue shirt\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172369_mykhailo_uvarov_nok-1024x908.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172369_mykhailo_uvarov_nok-300x266.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172369_mykhailo_uvarov_nok-768x681.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172369_mykhailo_uvarov_nok.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Phone scammer Mykhailo Uvarov is congratulated on being appointed honorary head of the Kyiv branch of the National Olympic Committee<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most curious part? Uvarov\u2019s wife Kateryna, the same woman who once begged for help online, saying she was trapped in an abusive relationship, got so rich during the war that she apparently no longer wants saving. Time heals, they say. Or maybe it\u2019s just money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the State Register of Property Rights, Kateryna Yevtushenko is now the proud owner of a large 210-square-meter house in the village of Lebedivka, Vyshhorod district near Kyiv \u2014 inside the upscale GoldFish cottage community. The property sits on a 0.0623-hectare plot of land, which also belongs to her. She bought it not long ago \u2014 on April 3, 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on current market prices, a basic unfinished house of that size in GoldFish costs around <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/novostroyka-km-goldfish-9074\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">$280,000<\/a>.

One is a 2024 Land Rover Range Rover, registered in her name since August 18, 2024, with an average market <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/newauto\/marka-land-rover\/model-range-rover\/year-2024\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">value<\/a> of $250,000. The other is a 2023 BMW Alpina XB7, registered since March 19, 2025, also <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_bmw-alpina_xb7_38136274.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> around $250,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, for about a million dollars in \u201cgifts,\u201d you can overlook domestic abuse and your husband\u2019s criminal past too. Today, Uvarov\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/uvarov_m_n\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">social media<\/a> is filled with cozy photos of his kids and sentimental posts about his \u201cloving wife\u201d. A million dollars, earned through fraud and laundered via a house and luxury cars, can do wonders. We wonder if it will also help Uvarov clean up his image and turn from a domestic abuser and scammer into a respectable head of Kyiv\u2019s Olympic Committee, a caring father, and a generous philanthropist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru2\"><strong>How bodyguard and athlete Yevhen Trusov became a businessman<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The life of Uvarov\u2019s friend, 31-year-old Yevhen Trusov from the town of Berestyn (formerly Krasnohrad) in Kharkiv region, also changed completely. Before marrying Anna Denysenko from Mala Danylivka in 2021, Trusov lived like many Ukrainians \u2014 balancing a modest athletic career with odd jobs as a bodyguard, driver, coach, and rehab specialist. According to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/e.trusovv\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram<\/a> page, he worked at the Bubnovsky Rehabilitation Center from October 2019 until April 2020, where he promised to \u201celiminate pain in the neck, back, and joints\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in 2022, as the full-scale war began, Trusov suddenly turned businessman. On September 13, 2022, he registered as a sole proprietor focused on computer programming. Then on October 18, 2023, he founded a company called \u201cBilyardna\u201d \u2014 a food venue on 21 Velyka Zhytomyrska Street in Kyiv. In March 2024, he became head of the NGO \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rugbyclubkyiv\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Rugby Club Kyiv<\/a>\u201d, and in May 2024, co-founded \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/edr\/45357251\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Eco Sapropel<\/a>\u201d, a company that supposedly produces fertilizers and nitrogen compounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he didn\u2019t stop there. On June 7, 2024, Trusov launched another venture \u2014 an ad agency called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/edr\/45603573\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Community Cloud Keeper<\/a>\u201d. He also founded \u201cIkigai Group\u201d on February 20, 2024, with the stated business being real estate leasing and management. Notably, two of the co-founders are familiar names: Mykhailo Uvarov and Vladyslav Myroshnychenko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is interesting \u2014 according to official financial reports, almost all of these companies are either inactive or operating at a loss. \u201cBilyardna,\u201d which employs three people, ended 2024 with nearly half a million hryvnias in losses, despite a reported turnover of 2.7 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"237\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172383_tov_biliardna-1024x237.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1777\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172383_tov_biliardna-1024x237.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172383_tov_biliardna-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172383_tov_biliardna-768x177.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172383_tov_biliardna.png 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Financial report of Yevhen Trusov\u2019s company \u201cBilyardna\u201d<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company \u201cEco Sapropel\u201d had zero revenue in 2024 and ended the year with a loss of \u20b4800,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"263\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel-1024x263.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1778\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel-1024x263.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel-300x77.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel-768x197.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel-1536x395.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172433_tov_eko_sapropel.png 1572w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Financial report of Yevhen Trusov\u2019s company \u201cEco Sapropel\u201d<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIkigai Group\u201d also operated at a loss: with an authorized capital of \u20b416.7 million, the company, which officially has only one employee, made no money in 2024 and finished the year with a loss of \u20b480,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"240\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup-1024x240.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1779\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup-1024x240.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup-300x70.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup-768x180.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup-1536x360.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172438_tov_ikigai_grup.png 1606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Financial report of the company \u201cIkigai Group\u201d<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only one of Trusov\u2019s newly registered companies that made any money was the advertising agency \u201cCommunity Cloud Keeper\u201d.

Either way, Trusov has had no official source of income large enough to explain sudden wealth. And since there\u2019s no real estate or cars officially registered to his name, it almost seems like there\u2019s nothing to question. But there are a few \u201cbuts\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru3\"><strong>How Yuliia Trusova, mother of Yevhen Trusov, acquired property during the war<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Trusov has been busy registering unprofitable companies, his mother Yuliia Trusova, who lives in the town of Berestyn in Kharkiv region, has been acquiring property and vehicles. According to the State Register of Property Rights, on June 26, 2024, Yuliia Trusova purchased a 34-square-meter apartment in Berestyn, <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-kvartira-krasnograd-3-y-mikrorayon-nezavisimosti-moskovskaya-ulitsa-32513604.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> around $20,000. A few months later, in October 2024, she acquired another plot of land (0.1 hectares) in the same town along with a residential house on it measuring 103.6 square meters \u2014 together worth at least $40,000. According to YouControl, on January 30, 2024, she also became the owner of a 2017 Mazda CX-5, which typically sells for <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/car\/mazda\/cx-5\/year\/2017\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">at least<\/a> $20,000 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuliia Trusova is an ordinary resident of a small district town. She has no business ownership and is not registered as an entrepreneur. So it seems likely that the source of her sudden access to real estate and a vehicle in 2024 is her son \u2014 the owner of loss-making businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru4\"><strong>How Anna Denysenko made $6 million in real estate and cars during wartime<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But Yevhen Trusov\u2019s wife Anna Denysenko is doing even better.

Another purchase, made on October 27, 2023, included a basement and ground-floor space totaling 111.8 square meters at 33A Yaroslav Mudryi Street, for around $134,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her most valuable assets are located at 140A Poltavskyi Shlyakh Street in Kharkiv.

Denysenko also owns a 0.2123-hectare plot of land near a lake in the Derhachi district of Kharkiv region, which she purchased on March 20, 2017, for about $36,000 at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to YouControl, Anna Trusova also owns two cars. In 2016, she bought a 2013 Mercedes-Benz ML 250 CDI 4Matic, valued at around $25,000. In 2025, she added a green 2025 Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid to her garage, which costs upwards of $135,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not bad for a 30-year-old woman from the village of Mala Danylivka in Kharkiv region, right? Her only known official source of income is a private business (FOP), registered in 2012, with its main activity listed as \u201ccomfort services\u201d, whatever that means. But most business owners in Ukraine would agree: it\u2019s nearly impossible to earn over $6 million through such a business alone. So, where did all the money come from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru5\"><strong>Call centers and crypto: what Yevhen Trusov and Anna Denysenko are really doing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GetContact app, which shows how a phone number is saved in other people\u2019s contact lists, often reveals a lot of useful information. Trusov\u2019s number, for example, is listed under names like \u201cYevhen Rehabilitator\u201d, \u201cYevhen Azov Activist\u201d, and \u201cZhenia Security Altbir\u201d. But it also shows up as \u201cZhenia Office Kharkiv\u201d and \u201cZhenia Offices\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ukraine, \u201coffices\u201d is a common slang term for illegal call centers \u2014 the kind that scam people over the phone by tricking them into sending money. These are the same kinds of operations that scandal-plagued MP Mykola Tyshchenko once pretended to \u201ccrack down on\u201d for PR. As mentioned earlier, Trusov\u2019s friend and business partner Mykhailo Uvarov is deeply involved in these call centers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Trusov\u2019s wife, Anna\u2019s phone number in GetContact comes with some equally telling tags: \u201cAnna Assistant SA\u201d, \u201cAnna Crypto Investor Dubai\u201d, \u201cAnna SA Secretary Kyiv\u201d, \u201cWife of an Investor\u201d, \u201cAnna from Serhii Oleksiyovych\u201d, \u201cEurotrade Secretary SA\u201d, \u201cAnna Exchange 60 People\u201d, and \u201cAnna Dyrdin\u2019s Assistant\u201d. These suggest three things: first, Anna Denysenko either worked or still works as assistant or secretary to a certain Serhii Dyrdin; second, she is involved in crypto; and third, her husband Yevhen is likely involved in it too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is surprising, considering that Trusov is a close friend of Vladyslav Myroshnychenko \u2014 the guy who turned <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/vladyslav-myroshnychenko-how-a-hookah-specialist-from-kharkiv-became-a-crypto-expert-and-a-dollar-millionaire-evading-taxes\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">his crypto<\/a> earnings into a fortune, splurging on luxury real estate and expensive cars while skipping taxes. So, this could be the first clue as to where all those millions came from during wartime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\u2019s take a closer look at Serhii Dyrdin. He and a Cyprus-based company called Doisinda Ltd are the owners and founders of a Ukrainian company called UkrEuroStroy, which sells timber, construction materials, and plumbing equipment. This firm has repeatedly appeared in criminal cases related to tax evasion, including case No. <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/82735540\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">42018000000002780<\/a> from November 7, 2018, and No. <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/85928359\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">42019210000000153<\/a> from September 10, 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess what? The 2018 Porsche Cayenne that Yevhen Trusov drives around Kyiv, regularly violating traffic laws and catching police attention, is registered to none other than this very company. That\u2019s right, Trusov, the husband of Dyrdin\u2019s assistant, drives a Porsche tied to a firm with a history of shady dealings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"781\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172375_porsche_cayenne_yevghen_trusov-1024x781.png\" alt=\"A black Porsche Cayenne with two men inside\n\" class=\"wp-image-1783\" style=\"width:602px;height:auto\" title=\"A black Porsche Cayenne with two men inside\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172375_porsche_cayenne_yevghen_trusov-1024x781.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172375_porsche_cayenne_yevghen_trusov-300x229.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172375_porsche_cayenne_yevghen_trusov-768x586.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172375_porsche_cayenne_yevghen_trusov.png 1324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Yevhen Trusov behind the wheel of a Porsche Cayenne registered to \u201cUkrEuroStroy\u201d LLC<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tru6\"><strong>How Anna Denysenko\u2019s parents made money from scam schemes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more interesting, it\u2019s not just Yevhen Trusov and his wife Anna Denysenko who are tied to Serhii Dyrdin. Turns out, Anna\u2019s mother, Tamara Denysenko, is also in on it. Dyrdin\u2019s wife, Svitlana Dyrdina, who used to be <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/e8b91637-dc9d-4b3d-afcc-f15e95e8fdaf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">chief legal adviser<\/a> at the National Bank of Ukraine in 2016\u20132017, co-founded a company called \u201cSoldat 2020\u201d together with Tamara.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where we arrive at the second major theory behind the couple\u2019s sudden wartime millions: shady real estate deals, thanks to Anna\u2019s parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with \u201cSoldat 2020\u201d, which was the key player in criminal case <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/92813574\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">No. 12020220000000037<\/a>, opened on January 15, 2020. Investigators found that between 2019 and 2020, the director of another company, PFC Khrystyna LTD, signed bogus contracts with \u201cSoldat 2020\u201d, allowing the latter to illegally take possession of several commercial properties that belonged to PFC Khrystyna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme was simple: the director of PFC Khrystyna, without the founders\u2019 knowledge or approval, sold prime commercial space in central Kharkiv (at 11 Nauky Ave. and 33A Yaroslava Mudroho St.) to \u201cSoldat 2020\u201d, the freshly registered company owned by Tamara Denysenko and Svitlana Dyrdina. These properties were the company\u2019s main source of income \u2014 and suddenly, they were gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspiciously, \u201cSoldat 2020\u201d was registered on December 2, 2019, and just one day later, it became the official owner of the PFC Khrystyna properties. If that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cfraud\u201d, we don\u2019t know what does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the court froze the properties now owned by Tamara Denysenko. But on December 12, 2022, a judge <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/107825171\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">lifted the freeze<\/a>, and on January 24, 2023, another court refused to even consider an appeal filed by the original property owners. Just like that, the valuable downtown real estate was secured, likely thanks to corruption, and later, those same properties were quietly re-registered in Anna Denysenko\u2019s name. A neat little family arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s not the only shady deal the Denysenko clan is involved in. The family also owns a farming business called \u201cDenysenko\u201d, which operates in freshwater fishing. The firm hasn\u2019t filed any financial reports \u2014 ever \u2014 but it did show up in a criminal case (<a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/66176456\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">No. 42017221280000022<\/a> from March 30, 2017). According to the case file, from July to December 2014, the company illegally used water from the Lozovenkivske Reservoir without a permit and without paying environmental fees, causing environmental and financial damages of about 230,000 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more telling, investigators found that the company\u2019s water pumping equipment was actually located at 28 Zelen\u0430 Street in Mala Danylivka \u2014 on a massive 10.72-hectare plot of land with a 420 m\u00b2 residential house. Both the land and the house are registered to Anna Denysenko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are probably just the fraud cases that made it into official police records. Because the rest of Anna Denysenko\u2019s multi-million-dollar real estate empire, aside from the properties seized from PFC Khrystyna, still needs explaining. And not just hers, but her parents\u2019 as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out Tamara and Oleksandr Denysenko aren\u2019t doing too badly themselves. According to Ukraine\u2019s property registry, they own 17 land plots covering more than 18 hectares in Mala Danylivka, 16 commercial properties in Kharkiv and Mala Danylivka totaling 3,439.5 m\u00b2, an apartment in Kharkiv, and two houses \u2014 one in Kharkiv and one back home in their village. Altogether, their real estate is worth an estimated $3 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you add that to Anna Denysenko\u2019s portfolio, the family is sitting on at least $9 million worth of property \u2014 all while Yevhen Trusov is officially broke and his businesses are running at a loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/05\\\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1784&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:3776,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-1024x679.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1784\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-1024x679.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-768x509.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-1536x1019.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/cleaned1748172316_trusov-inf-2048x1359.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Property owned by Yevhen Trusov\u2019s wife, Anna Denysenko, and her parents.

Or rather, the magic of a charity fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 1999, there was a small foundation called the \u201cKharkiv Regional Charity Fund for Humanitarian Aid\u201d. In February 2023, it quietly changed hands and landed in the lap of a now-familiar trio: Yevhen Trusov, Mykhailo Uvarov, and Vitalii Dukhopelov. They registered themselves as co-founders, with their buddy Vladyslav Myroshnychenko, the hookah guy turned crypto millionaire, installed as director. They rebranded the fund as \u201cFund 1654\u201d, and its Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kharkiv.fond.1654\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">account<\/a> began pumping out content about supporting the KRAKEN military group. The group\u2019s official <a href=\"https:\/\/kraken-gur.army\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> even now lists \u201cFund 1654\u201d as its affiliated charity. Sounds noble, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a> discovered that this charity is allegedly being used to funnel large amounts of money \u2014 some of which likely comes from illegal sources. The idea? Use the fund as a cover to launder dirty money under the guise of helping Ukraine\u2019s defenders. And in doing so, earn the protection of security forces. A win-win \u2014 if you&#8217;re running scams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the Denysenko family plays a central role in all this. Before February 13, 2018, Anna Denysenko was listed as the fund\u2019s official beneficiary. Her parents, Tamara and Oleksandr Denysenko, have long been tied to shady operations involving the organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One criminal case, No. 12014220510003006, opened on November 12, 2014, reveals one such scam. According to investigators, the foundation, together with Tamara Denysenko\u2019s private business, managed to steal over \u20ac54,000 worth of commercial kitchen equipment. The shipment was delivered to 140A Poltavskyi Shliakh Street \u2014 the fund\u2019s registered address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what happened: the supplier, \u201cTekhnolohiyi Obladnannia\u201d, had signed a supply contract with \u201cBarvinok\u201d LLC for over 1.2 million UAH worth of equipment. But after the shipment arrived, it somehow ended up with Tamara Denysenko\u2019s private firm, allegedly just for \u201ctemporary storage\u201d. When the rightful owners tried to reclaim it, an unknown man locked them inside the premises \u2014 and the equipment conveniently stayed in the fund\u2019s hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another case, No. 12019220510003059, opened on December 20, 2019, shows that the same address (140A Poltavskyi Shliakh) also housed an illegal gambling. A \u201cSportloto\u201d sign even hung above the entrance. At the time, Tamara Denysenko was the fund\u2019s official representative, and its founders were Halyna and Vitalii Ishchenko, whom we believe may be relatives of the Denysenko family. One number in GetContact, tied to a man named Oleksandr Ishchenko, had tags like \u201cSasha Denysenko\u201d and \u201cFat Sanya 1\u201d. Coincidence? Probably not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it turns out the masterminds behind the Trusov\u2013Uvarov\u2013Myroshnychenko triangle aren\u2019t the boys at all. The real power players are Anna Denysenko\u2019s parents, Tamara and Oleksandr, a couple from the village of Mala Danylivka who built their wealth on property scams, illegal land grabs, fake \u201chumanitarian\u201d schemes, and money laundering operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their daughter, Anna, likely reinvests that dirty cash not just in land, luxury homes, and expensive cars, but also in cryptocurrency. And her husband Yevhen Trusov? Once a simple rehab therapist, he gave up his day job after marrying into the family and joined the crew, bringing his own shady friends along for the ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re wondering how some people manage to strike it rich during wartime, the Denysenko clan just gave us one more answer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not everyone in Ukraine is struggling during the war.

How she pulled it off and who\u2019s backing her anti-Ukrainian activity \u2014 in our new investigation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna Alkhim got rich fast. A few years on social media were enough. On one hand, it\u2019s not surprising. Stirring up drama brings followers, and followers bring advertisers. On the other hand, many \u201csuccessful\u201d influencers share a simple secret: the fewer taxes you pay, the more money you keep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, her large-scale tax evasion has gone unnoticed by law enforcement. But in May 2025, Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU) opened a criminal case against her \u2014 based on complaints from MP Nataliia Pipa and war veteran Oleksandr Teren. Alkhim is being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unian.ua\/incidents\/anna-alhim-stala-figurantom-troh-kriminalnih-sprav-13010676.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">investigated<\/a> under three articles of the Criminal Code: Article 161 \u201cViolation of equality of citizens,\u201d Article 346 \u201cThreat or violence against a public figure,\u201d and Article 111 \u201cHigh treason.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"al1\"><strong>How Anna Alkhim Provoked Ukrainians with Pro-russian Statements and Stunts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The breaking <a href=\"https:\/\/nv.ua\/ukr\/socium\/skandal-z-alhim-teren-i-mandzyuk-zhorstko-zasudili-alhim-yaka-vidmovilasya-spivati-ukrajinskoyu-video-50511306.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">point<\/a> came at a party in May 2025, hosted by blogger Stasia Makeieva. When asked to sing something in Ukrainian, Alkhim rolled her eyes and refused. The reaction online was immediate. But this wasn\u2019t her first stunt. She had already provoked backlash with her pro-russian views.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2020, she <a href=\"https:\/\/www.obozrevatel.com\/shou-oboz\/skandalnomu-blogeru-alhim-obyavili-vojnu-kotoraya-zadela-top-zvezd-ukrainyi-chto-proishodit.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">called<\/a> russian dictator vladimir putin a \u201ccool guy\u201d on Instagram, claiming there was \u201cno one cooler\u201d. When criticism followed, she doubled down, saying only \u201cfake patriots\u201d were offended and that she saw no reason to apologize. She was later added to the <a href=\"https:\/\/myrotvorets.center\/criminal\/alkhymova-anna-nykolaevna\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Myrotvorets<\/a> database for her anti-Ukrainian rhetoric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion didn\u2019t change her tune. In a 2024 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbc.ua\/ukr\/styler\/dizlayk-i-vidpiska-slavu-domina-zaheytili-1714127140.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">interview<\/a>, she repeated that there\u2019s \u201cno one cooler or more influential than putin\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same interview, she said she had no intention of switching to Ukrainian and called most Ukrainian music \u201ctotal crap\u201d. In 2022, while millions of Ukrainians were boycotting russian music, Alkhim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.obozrevatel.com\/person\/anna-alhim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">boasted<\/a> about listening to it on streaming platforms. Worse, in January 2024, she <a href=\"https:\/\/apostrophe.ua\/ua\/article\/lime\/learn\/2024-01-25\/blogersha-alhim-na-allee-pogibshih-geroev-zapisala-veseloe-video-pod-russkuyu-pesnyu\/56225\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">filmed<\/a> a video set to russian music in front of a memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers in Khmelnytskyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, she shared the <a href=\"https:\/\/hvylya.net\/uk\/news\/273262-prilet-po-bolnice-v-dnepre-blogersha-anna-alhim-opravdalas-za-storis-posle-kotoroy-rashisty-nanesli-udar%23google_vignette\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">location<\/a> of Ukrainian soldiers in a Dnipro hospital on Instagram. Soon after, a russian missile strike hit the site. Alkhim denied any responsibility \u2014 and instead called Ukrainians \u201ca dumb herd\u201d. That August, she insulted western Ukrainians by calling their region \u201ca factory of idiots\u201d for demanding she speak the state language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise law enforcement finally took interest. Her stubborn anti-Ukrainian stance suggests two possibilities: either she\u2019s being paid to promote pro-russian narratives during wartime, or she simply lacks the intelligence to grasp reality. Either way, the first option is worth investigating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a third explanation. Alkhim is famous for one thing only \u2014 her provocative, anti-Ukrainian antics. That might be her entire business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"al2\"><strong>How Anna Alkhim Hides Her Assets by Registering Them Under Close Associates<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alkhimova, 33, was born in the town of Ternivka, Dnipropetrovsk region. Her work history is short. From 2010 to 2012, she worked at a private firm in Pavlohrad. In 2013, she briefly served as a court clerk. That\u2019s all that\u2019s publicly known. She\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/84486985\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">divorced<\/a> from Oleksandr Buriachenko, the father of her 5-year-old son, Volodymyr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ukraine\u2019s property registry, she owns very little. Since 2014, she has held two land plots in the village of Bohdanivka, plus a modest house \u2014 all valued at around $50,000 and received as a gift. As of 2025, the only vehicle registered to her is a black 2020 Yamaha YZF-R3 motorcycle, <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_yamaha_r3_37916559.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> about $5,500.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet in one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@podcast_tymoshenko\/video\/7364349209199349009\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">interview<\/a>, she claimed to own a house, two cars, and multiple luxury watches, each worth around $50,000. When asked if she had $1 million in assets, she smiled in agreement. On social media she posts photos of fancy cars and a suburban home \u2014 though none of them are officially hers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285216_anna_alkhim_budynok_bentley-1024x693.png\" alt=\"Anna Alkhim, dressed in a burgundy leather jacket, gets into a grey Bentley parked by her country house\n\" class=\"wp-image-1796\" title=\"Anna Alkhim, dressed in a burgundy leather jacket, gets into a grey Bentley parked by her country house\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285216_anna_alkhim_budynok_bentley-1024x693.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285216_anna_alkhim_budynok_bentley-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285216_anna_alkhim_budynok_bentley-768x519.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285216_anna_alkhim_budynok_bentley.png 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Anna Alkhim in front of her suburban house next to a brand-new Bentley Continental GT.

According to Google Maps, it&#8217;s a cottage with a swimming pool on the property. Similar homes with pools in Hatne typically <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-dom-gatnoe-31749393.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">cost<\/a> around $230,000 \u2014 or nearly 10 million UAH. It&#8217;s doubtful that Anna Alkhim\u2019s parents could afford such a purchase on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family runs a small funeral business registered under Mykola Alkhimov\u2019s name as a <a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/edr\/1803917639\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sole proprietor<\/a> since 1998, based in the village of Bohdanivka, Dnipropetrovsk region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years ago, Anna Alkhim showed and described her upbringing in Bohdanivka on her <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZQguA-OxUXk?t=1300\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel<\/a>. At the time, her mother worked at a funeral service called \u201cVichnist\u201d (\u201cEternity\u201d). A banner for the business appeared in the video, listing both her mother\u2019s and father\u2019s phone numbers. This clearly points to a small, local business without a website or significant online presence \u2014 hardly a major source of income capable of funding a luxury home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"994\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285241_anna_alkhim_pokhoronne_buro_vechnost-994x1024.png\" alt=\"Anna Alkhim enters the \u201cVichnist\u201d funeral home\n\" class=\"wp-image-1799\" style=\"width:723px;height:auto\" title=\"Anna Alkhim enters the \u201cVichnist\u201d funeral home\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285241_anna_alkhim_pokhoronne_buro_vechnost-994x1024.png 994w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285241_anna_alkhim_pokhoronne_buro_vechnost-291x300.png 291w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285241_anna_alkhim_pokhoronne_buro_vechnost-768x791.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285241_anna_alkhim_pokhoronne_buro_vechnost.png 1198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>\u201cVichnist\u201d funeral home owned by Anna Alkhim\u2019s parents.

We visited the address in Hatne and found the very same house that Anna Alkhim has featured in her social media posts. The photos clearly show that she and her son Volodymyr live there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"691\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285276_budynok_anny_alkhim_gatne-1024x691.png\" alt=\"A country house with a brown fence\n\" class=\"wp-image-1800\" title=\"A country house with a brown fence\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285276_budynok_anny_alkhim_gatne-1024x691.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285276_budynok_anny_alkhim_gatne-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285276_budynok_anny_alkhim_gatne-768x518.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285276_budynok_anny_alkhim_gatne.png 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Suburban house in Hatne near Kyiv where blogger Anna Alkhim lives, registered under her father Mykola Alkhimov.

But the house isn\u2019t the only thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alkhim\u2019s social media reveals that she has a personal assistant who also serves as a nanny for her son Volodymyr. The phone number of 41-year-old Yuliia Makohon, originally from the village of Chmyrivka in Luhansk region, is saved in contacts, according to the GetContact app, as \u201cYulia Nanny Alkhim\u201d, \u201cYuliya Assistant Alkhim\u201d, and \u201cYulia Hatne Alkhim\u201d. According to YouControl, as of 2025, Yuliia Makohon is listed as the owner of a black 2022 Land Rover Range Rover, which she officially acquired on March 16, 2024. The average value of such a vehicle is <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_land_rover_range_rover_37660878.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">around<\/a> $160,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The car wasn\u2019t actually bought by the nanny Yuliia, but by Anna Alkhim herself. After all, Alkhim has posted photos on Instagram driving this very Land Rover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"533\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285229_anna_alkhim_land_rover-533x1024.png\" alt=\"Anna Alkhim behind the wheel of a Land Rover Range Rover in front of Yellow Place restaurant in Kyiv\" class=\"wp-image-1801\" style=\"width:410px;height:auto\" title=\"Anna Alkhim behind the wheel of a Land Rover Range Rover in front of Yellow Place restaurant in Kyiv\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285229_anna_alkhim_land_rover-533x1024.png 533w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285229_anna_alkhim_land_rover-156x300.png 156w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1749285229_anna_alkhim_land_rover.png 570w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Blogger Anna Alkhim drives a Land Rover Range Rover registered under her son\u2019s nanny, Yuliia Makohon.

As recorded in the <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/116037909\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Unified State Register of Court Decisions<\/a>, on December 2, 2023, Anna Alkhimova was caught driving a Land Rover Range Rover on Mykola Mikhnovsky Boulevard in Kyiv while under the influence of alcohol and during curfew hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police officers noted in the official report that she had alcohol on her breath, slurred speech, and impaired coordination. She refused to undergo a breathalyzer test on-site using the Dr\u00e4ger device, as well as a medical examination by a narcologist. This refusal violated clause 2.5 of the Ukrainian Traffic Rules and resulted in charges under Article 130, Part 1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses (CAO).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same court decision states that Alkhimova did not dispute the fact that she had refused the test. Meanwhile, her lawyer, Serhii Zhylich, tried to mislead the court by submitting a falsified medical report from \u201cML Dila\u201d. The judge, however, issued a separate ruling to inform Kyiv\u2019s Qualification and Disciplinary Bar Commission about the forged documents and found Alkhimova guilty of the administrative offense. She was fined 17,000 UAH and banned from driving for one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, this wasn\u2019t her first offense. Just a month earlier, on November 12, 2023, at 5:30 p.m., Alkhimova crashed into a steel barrier near the Respublika Mall in Kyiv and damaged the mall\u2019s property. She fled the scene without reporting the accident. The court <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/116492939\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">found her guilty<\/a> of violating Articles 122-4 and 124 of the CAO and also revoked her driving privileges for one year.What\u2019s even more curious is that both incidents involved the same vehicle, but with different license plates. The first time, it was registered under KA6666IX, and a month later, it was KA2561KH. Moreover, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigations\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, even after both court rulings, Alkhimova didn\u2019t switch to public transport.

The company\u2019s official activity is listed as \u201cother forms of education\u201d. No other legal entities are registered under Alkhimova\u2019s name. The only known source through which the blogger can legally receive her substantial income is her individual entrepreneur status (<a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/fop\/12276746\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">FOP<\/a>), which she registered on May 2, 2018, with her primary activity listed as advertising services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, under Ukrainian law, FOPs in the 3rd group are limited to annual revenue of \u20b49,336,000 (roughly $227,000). According to data from <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigations\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Anna Alkhimova\u2019s FOP reported the following income over recent years:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2019 \u2014 \u20b41,200,222 ($44,701)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020 \u2014 \u20b44,874,571 ($175,915)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021 \u2014 \u20b44,661,636 ($171,321)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022 \u2014 \u20b4409,798 ($11,209)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023 \u2014 \u20b44,946,520 ($131,731)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2024 \u2014 \u20b45,458,391 ($133,784)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2025 (January\u2013March) \u2014 \u20b4596,750 ($14,208)<br><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this, Alkhimova officially declares annual earnings of around $130,000\u2013$175,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbc.ua\/rus\/styler\/ponad-70-tisyach-dolariv-skilki-zaroblyayut-1710593382.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> by Ukrainian media, Alkhim herself has claimed to earn more than $50,000 per month from advertising on her social media. According to the same reports, a single Instagram story from Alkhim costs at least \u20ac1,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To verify this, we contacted her manager, Yevheniia Bukhalska, pretending to be a potential advertiser. We asked for current pricing to place ads on Alkhim\u2019s social media.

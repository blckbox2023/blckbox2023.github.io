A year later, in August 2023, the regulator <a href=\"https:\/\/bank.gov.ua\/ua\/news\/all\/natsionalniy-bank-uhvaliv-rishennya-vidklikati-bankivsku-litsenziyu-ta-likviduvati-at-akb-konkord\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">revoked its license<\/a> and shut down JSC &#8220;AKB Concord&#8221;. This decision was based on the results of official inspections, which showed that the bank regularly violated laws on anti-money laundering, countering terrorism financing, and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, Concord Bank processed around 25% of Ukraine\u2019s gambling market \u2014 most of it operating without paying taxes. The bank used a scheme called miscoding, where transactions were incorrectly labeled to hide their true purpose. This allowed businesses to avoid taxes and caused huge losses to the state budget every year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead of accepting the National Bank\u2019s decision, the bank\u2019s founders \u2014 sisters Olena and Yuliia Sosedka \u2014 went to court. In May 2024, the Dnipro District Administrative Court sided with them and ruled the NBU\u2019s decision <a href=\"https:\/\/biz.censor.net\/news\/3493141\/bank_konkord_povernuv_litsenziyu_cherez_sud\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">illegal<\/a>. The National Bank has appealed the ruling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the legal battle over Concord Bank\u2019s future continues, we decided to take a closer look at what this financial institution was actually doing in its final years \u2014 and whether there really was a good reason to shut it down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"Two women wearing scarves standing in front of an office building\" class=\"wp-image-1598\" title=\"Two women wearing scarves standing in front of an office building\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841425_yuliya_i_olena_sosedka_concord_bank.jpeg 1538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Yuliia (left) and Olena (right) Sosedka \u2014 founders of Concord Bank. Photo: Delo.ua<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos1\"><strong>Where Concord Bank\u2019s Profits Came From<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concord Bank was actually a small financial institution. Its main source of income wasn\u2019t issuing loans \u2014 it was internet acquiring. This means processing online payments made with bank cards. In some years, this service brought in far more profit than lending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in the first half of 2021, acquiring generated \u20b4612 million in revenue for the bank \u2014 nearly five times more than it earned from issuing loans. Compared to the same period in 2020, Concord&#8217;s acquiring income had grown by a third.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this income came from so-called &#8220;high-risk&#8221; transactions \u2014 legal but risky payments, such as those made to online casinos and betting sites. \u201cThis includes any transactions where the buyer might later ask for a refund,\u201d explained Olena Sosedka, head of Concord Bank\u2019s supervisory board. \u201cIt\u2019s not just gambling and betting \u2014 it could also be things like plane tickets.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\u2019s no surprise that when the National Bank of Ukraine decided to liquidate Concord Bank \u2014 which, as of 2021, ranked 36th out of 72 Ukrainian banks with total assets of \u20b45 billion \u2014 it stated that removing the bank wouldn\u2019t affect the stability of the banking system. Concord\u2019s share of total assets across all solvent banks was only 0.17%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But based on what we\u2019ve found, it seems that Olena and Yuliia Sosedka never aimed to grow a traditional bank with a strong loan portfolio and broad customer base. Instead, they likely focused on something else: earning money by helping to conduct fake financial transactions or converting illegal funds into cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos2\"><strong>Why the National Bank Revoked Concord Bank\u2019s License and Shut It Down<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In court, the National Bank of Ukraine explained its decision to shut down Concord Bank by citing the results of an internal audit. According to the audit, the bank systematically failed to monitor the risks associated with its clients. It didn\u2019t identify signs that its services were being used to launder illegal money. It also failed to reassess clients&#8217; risk levels or simply didn\u2019t do it at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, Concord Bank turned a blind eye to countless financial transactions through which illegal businesses laundered dirty money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who were these clients? The audit mentioned the following companies: FC Hunter LLC, Parishat LLC, Torpari 2020 LLC, Hanoi LLC, and Latriks Group LLC. Almost no public information is available about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ukraine\u2019s Unified State Register of Legal Entities, three of these companies \u2014 Parishat, Torpari 2020, and Hanoi \u2014 were founded by the same person, Mykola Kramarchuk. He set them up in different months of 2020, all with the same declared activity: data processing, website hosting, and related services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that in August 2020, the Ukrainian government officially legalized the gambling business. That\u2019s likely when and why these companies were created \u2014 to serve online casinos and betting platforms. And it\u2019s no coincidence that they showed up in the National Bank\u2019s audit as clients involved in laundering illegal gambling profits through Concord Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another company flagged in the audit was FC Hunter \u2014 a financial company providing money transfer services. Like Concord Bank, it\u2019s based in Dnipro. Since 2020, it has been owned by Yuliia Diomina. Under her management, the company started reporting massive revenues \u2014 between \u20b4192 million and \u20b4642 million per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, the National Bank revoked FC Hunter\u2019s license \u2014 on the same grounds as Concord Bank: involvement in money laundering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos3\"><strong>How Concord Bank Faked the Capital of Its Clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Ukraine\u2019s financial regulator flagged suspicious activity at Olena and Yuliia Sosedka\u2019s bank. Back in 2016, the National Bank of Ukraine caught Concord Bank engaging in fraudulent financial operations. At the center of the scheme was a group of 19 Concord Bank clients who circulated the same 1 million UAH among themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That money had been received as a \u201crepayable financial aid\u201d by one of the group members. Within just a week \u2014 between July 5 and July 13, 2016 \u2014 the companies ran this same 1 million through a series of 30 transactions, each just minutes apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, 18 of them were able to \u201cartificially\u201d inflate their authorized capital to 420 million UAH. One other company received funds for corporate rights worth 30 million UAH. Some of these companies were later used to convert money into cash, which was then withdrawn from Concord Bank and moved to other banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/03\\\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-scaled.jpeg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1599&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1811,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: Infographic by the National Bank of Ukraine showing how Concord Bank\\u2019s clients, with the bank\\u2019s help, artificially inflated their statutory capitals\\n&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Infographic by the National Bank of Ukraine showing how Concord Bank\\u2019s clients, with the bank\\u2019s help, artificially inflated their statutory capitals\\n&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-1024x724.jpeg\" alt=\"Infographic by the National Bank of Ukraine showing how Concord Bank\u2019s clients, with the bank\u2019s help, artificially inflated their statutory capitals\n\" class=\"wp-image-1599\" title=\"Infographic by the National Bank of Ukraine showing how Concord Bank\u2019s clients, with the bank\u2019s help, artificially inflated their statutory capitals\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-1024x724.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-300x212.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-768x543.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-1536x1086.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841284_schema_formuvannya_fiktyvnogo_statutnogo_kapitalu_concord_bank-2048x1448.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: Infographic by the National Bank of Ukraine showing how Concord Bank\u2019s clients, with the bank\u2019s help, artificially inflated their statutory capitals\n\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>How the scheme for artificially inflating charter capital worked among Concord Bank clients.

Instead of holding the Sosedka sisters accountable for their role in the scheme \u2014 or at least for turning a blind eye to it \u2014 the regulator simply fined their bank. In 2018, Concord Bank was penalized only 1.2 million UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos4\"><strong>How Olena and Yuliia Sosedka Helped Businesses Avoid Taxes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On her Facebook page, Concord Bank\u2019s co-founder Olena Sosedka <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/elena.sosyedka\/videos\/1616811582378653\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">stated<\/a> that there were \u201cno criminal cases\u201d against Concord Bank or against her and her sister Yuliia. But that\u2019s simply not true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found at least four criminal investigations opened over the past decade in which either Concord Bank or the Sosedka sisters were directly involved. All were opened under Article 212 of Ukraine\u2019s Criminal Code \u2014 tax evasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2016, tax officials in Dnipropetrovsk region discovered a conversion center operating out of an office on Sichovykh Striltsiv Street 94 in Kyiv. That office was owned by Olena and Yuliia Sosedka and their business partners Dmytro and Olena Fomenko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a search of the premises, investigators found documents showing illegal financial operations by a company called HUT LLC. From January to May 2016, this company evaded nearly \u20b42 million in VAT and another \u20b42 million in profit tax by hiding its real sales volumes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the company was using the Sosedka sisters\u2019 office space to create fake paperwork for non-existent transactions and convert non-cash funds into cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second case was opened in October 2022, involving UkrTatNafta PJSC. Investigators found that on February 17, 2022, the company signed a fake $20 million contract with Swiss company NORDWIND TRADE SA to buy crude oil. Using that fake contract, UkrTatNafta transferred $20 million from its account at Concord Bank to the Swiss company\u2019s account at Raiffeisen Bank International in Austria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"advanced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" title=\"\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Olena and Yuliia Sosedka were under surveillance in this case as possible participants in the scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third case \u2014 No. 3201510000000024 \u2014 was opened in October 2015. It centered on a large-scale money laundering operation inside Concord Bank. According to investigators, the Sosedka sisters, along with their business partner Vadym Yermolaiev \u2014 who is now under Ukrainian <a href=\"https:\/\/www.president.gov.ua\/documents\/8502023-49333\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sanctions<\/a> for moving his businesses to russia-occupied Crimea (a practice also linked to former Vinnytsia governor <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/yak-ochilnyk-vinnychyny-sergij-borzov-ta-deputatka-iryna-borzova-splachuyuyut-podatky-v-rf\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">Serhii Borzov<\/a>, who, however, was not sanctioned) and paying taxes to the enemy \u2014 helped companies evade taxes using Concord Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how the scheme worked: companies that wanted to hide money from taxes would transfer non-cash funds to their Concord Bank accounts. To avoid raising suspicions, fake documents and reports were created to make the transactions look legitimate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the money was handed back to the businesses \u2014 in cash. From 2014 to 2016, the Sosedka sisters reportedly ordered Concord Bank employees to rent safe deposit boxes inside the bank. These boxes were officially assigned to the employees, but the actual access was given to members of the conversion center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the money arrived in fake companies&#8217; accounts, Concord Bank staff would withdraw the cash and place it into those safes. Then, using powers of attorney, members of the conversion ring \u2014 led by Concord Bank employee Andrii Korchahin \u2014 would retrieve the cash and deliver it to clients. In return, the bank took a percentage of every transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme wasn\u2019t limited to Ukrainian clients. Foreign companies were involved too \u2014 including Whitesboro Limited, Quinn Holdings Sweden AB, and Vinci Capital Management Ltd. Outside Ukraine, Concord Bank ran transactions through a correspondent account at Estonia\u2019s Versobank, which belonged to Yermolaiev. In fact, on March 5, 2015, Concord Bank even published a statement on its website announcing the opening of a multi-currency account with Versobank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to case files:<br>\u201cUsing registration documents, the criminals opened accounts in Versobank AS. They received access to online banking and company seals. This allowed them to create fake contracts for selling goods or services to real businesses. They received payments for these fake deals, then turned the money into cash, avoiding both taxes and NBU limits. They also offered illegal foreign exchange services using fake contracts and offshore companies.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another criminal case \u2014 No. 3201504164000004, opened on September 8, 2015 \u2014 involved ProCard LLC, a payment processing company that helps businesses run card programs through Visa and Mastercard. From 2011 to 2024, the sole owner of ProCard was Yuliia Sosedka. The company has since been re-registered under the name of Kostiantyn Petrenko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators found that ProCard was involved in fake transactions between various companies, leading to a fraudulent VAT credit of over \u20b44 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems the Sosedka sisters somehow managed to avoid any serious consequences for all of this. But in Ukraine, that\u2019s unfortunately not surprising. So it\u2019s no wonder that Concord Bank \u2014 left unpunished for helping companies avoid taxes and laundering money \u2014 only grew bolder in its schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos5\"><strong>How Concord Bank Served Drug Traffickers and Illegal Gambling in russia<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, the founders of Concord Bank decided to go beyond legal high-risk operations and started working with illegal ones \u2014 including drug trafficking and underground gambling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 21, 2021, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Suex, a Russian-Czech crypto exchange service, for helping process transactions linked to illegal income. <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/system\/files\/126\/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">According to<\/a> the U.S. Treasury Department, over 40% of Suex\u2019s transactions were tied to criminal activity \u2014 including payments for drugs sold through Hydra, a russian darknet marketplace with an annual turnover of at least $1.5 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how is Concord Bank involved?

That exchange then allegedly routed money to Suex \u2014 the same exchange working with drug dealers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also reports that Concord Bank, through its processing center \u201cProCard\u201d and in cooperation with russia\u2019s Promsvyazbank \u2014 the main bank serving the russian defense sector, whose board members are kept secret \u2014 provided services to illegal betting platforms in russia and former Soviet states, as well as the crypto exchange FXCoin, which has also been linked to drug trade operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/03\\\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1600&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:4155,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: An infographic showing Concord Bank\\u2019s ties to the russian Promsvyazbank, illegal gambling operations, and drug trafficking&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;An infographic showing Concord Bank\\u2019s ties to the russian Promsvyazbank, illegal gambling operations, and drug trafficking&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"747\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-1024x747.png\" alt=\"An infographic showing Concord Bank\u2019s ties to the russian Promsvyazbank, illegal gambling operations, and drug trafficking\" class=\"wp-image-1600\" title=\"An infographic showing Concord Bank\u2019s ties to the russian Promsvyazbank, illegal gambling operations, and drug trafficking\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-1024x747.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-300x219.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-768x561.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-1536x1121.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742841298_sosedki-infographic-2048x1495.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: An infographic showing Concord Bank\u2019s ties to the russian Promsvyazbank, illegal gambling operations, and drug trafficking\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>How Concord Bank was involved in processing payments for drug traffickers and illegal bookmakers in russia.

It seems that Olena and Yuliia Sosedka have no problem doing business with russian citizens and aren\u2019t too picky when it comes to their connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Olena Sosedka registered property rights in occupied Crimea. To do that, she gave power of attorney to a russian citizen, Iryna Shportko. One of the Sosedka sisters&#8217; close friends is also a russian citizen \u2014 Darya Omelchenko. She has a russian phone number and is registered at an address in moscow: 52 Admiral Lazarev Street.

He\u2019s also a co-founder of the internet provider \u201cFregat.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his 2020 asset declaration, Viacheslav Mishalov claimed to own 18,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth over $1 billion at the time \u2014 along with a collection of 13 luxury watches from brands like Rolex, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Audemars Piguet, Breitling, and Glash\u00fctte, and a collection of rifles. But where did all that money come from? Possibly from budget money, which Mishalov was accused of embezzling by law enforcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2020, police and prosecutors launched an investigation into possible embezzlement by the company \u201cMaister-Bud,\u201d which installed heating systems in kindergartens and schools in Dnipro. The total contract was worth \u20b433.7 million. Investigators later found that \u201cMaister-Bud\u201d had inflated equipment costs by \u20b47.1 million and added fake transportation expenses worth another \u20b4588,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Mishalov was Secretary of the Dnipro City Council and had a direct connection to \u201cMaister-Bud.\u201d His father, Dmytro Mishalov \u2014 one of Dnipro\u2019s most powerful businessmen \u2014 was a co-owner of the company until 2018. Back in 2010, \u201cMaister-Bud\u201d won a $100 million government contract to build the roof of Kyiv\u2019s Olympic Stadium after gaining the trust of then\u2013Deputy Prime Minister Borys Kolesnikov. The boilers for the school heating project were supplied by \u201cLiberator,\u201d a company that owns a trademark registered to Viacheslav Mishalov himself. And, unsurprisingly, all financial operations went through Concord Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Dnipro Mayor Borys Filatov publicly accused the Mishalov family of corruption over delays in a major bridge repair project. The contract, worth \u20b4250 million, was awarded to \u201cZavod Maister-Profi,\u201d another company owned by Dmytro Mishalov. Filatov said he hoped the family would face criminal charges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that Dmytro and Viacheslav Mishalov both sat on the supervisory board of the Dnipropetrovsk Jewish community, alongside powerful figures like Ihor Kolomoiskyi, Hennadii Boholiubov, and Hennadii Korban. After Viacheslav became a city council member in 2015, \u201cMaister-Bud\u201d landed over \u20b42 billion in government contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sos7\"><strong>How Olena Sosedka Moved Millions from State-Owned Ukrgasbank to Austria<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Olena Sosedka traveled abroad 26 times during the three years of russia\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine.

In 2018, Olena Sosedka personally backed a loan that Bio Energy Dnipro received from Ukrgasbank to build a biogas power plant \u2014 part of a government project aimed at reducing natural gas use. But the project was likely fake, as the power plant was never built. The loan, however, was issued \u2014 and according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, never repaid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2022, Ukraine\u2019s Unified State Register of Court Decisions shows that Bio Energy Dnipro owed Ukrgasbank nearly \u20ac3.4 million. A court <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/106549398\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">issued<\/a> a debt recovery order to sell company assets worth \u20b418 million (about \u20ac493,000 at the time) \u2014 seven times less than the original loan amount. According to import-export records, $100,000 of the loan was transferred by Bio Energy Dnipro in November 2019 to Concord Solutions Lab GmbH \u2014 another company controlled by Olena Sosedka. It\u2019s likely that the rest of the loan money ended up the same way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the court banned Sosedka\u2019s company \u2014 and her second son\u2019s father, Serhii Dovhaliuk \u2014 from building the biogas plant. This means \u20ac3 million from a state-owned bank was never used as intended, and never returned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding another twist, from 2016 to 2018 the director of both APS Power Technology GmbH and Concord Solutions Lab GmbH \u2014 companies linked to the Concord Group \u2014 was Alexandre Egger. He\u2019s a lawyer who represented former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov in the European Court of Human Rights. Given his background, it\u2019s likely Olena Sosedka used Egger to help quietly move public funds from Ukraine to Austria.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The founders of the

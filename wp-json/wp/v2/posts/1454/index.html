Over the past few years, it has aggressively expanded into Ukraine\u2019s school and kindergarten catering market, securing one multimillion-dollar tender after another. It seems the state is actively supporting the Lithuanian company, clearing the way by reducing competition from Ukrainian companies. At the same time, Pontem.UA consistently faces complaints from parents about the quality of the meals they provide. The company has been accused of violating labor laws and delaying employee salaries. Despite these issues, the company is now aiming to supply food for the military. Who is protecting the questionable business practices of Irmantas Norkus, the Lithuanian businessman?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of June 1, the catering services on Ukraine&#8217;s Intercity high-speed trains have been taken over by a new player \u2014 LLC Pontem.UA. Replacing WOG, which had served the railway for the past eight years, Pontem.UA won the Ukrzaliznytsia tender, securing the rights to lease restaurant cars and provide catering services on 16 high-speed trains for the next five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yurfirtasha\"><strong>Lawyer for Dmytro Firtash and Yurii Ivaniushchenko, Valerii Hudenko, Takes on Feeding Ukrainian Schoolchildren<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>LLC &#171;Pontem.UA,&#187; specializing in providing ready-made meals, entered the Ukrainian market in July 2016. The company was established as a subsidiary of the Lithuanian firm <a href=\"https:\/\/rekvizitai.vz.lt\/ru\/company\/uab_baltijos_paslaugu_grupe\/\">Baltijos Paslaugu Grupe<\/a>, whose ultimate beneficiary is Lithuanian citizen Irmantas Norkus. Initially, the Ukrainian branch was headed by another Lithuanian, Audrius Janu\u0161kaitis. Today, the company is managed by 55-year-old Ukrainian Valeriy Hudenko, while Volodymyr Tsyba has served as the official signatory since January 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valeriy Hudenko previously <a href=\"https:\/\/uadvokat.com.ua\/reestr\/kiev\/kiev\/gudenko-valeriy-evgenovich.html\">worked<\/a> as a lawyer for companies linked to former allies of Viktor Yanukovych, including Ukragro NPK, owned by oligarch Dmytro Firtash, and Zakhidinkombank, connected to Yuriy Ivanyushchenko\u2014an ex-MP from the Party of Regions, better known as &#171;Yura Yenakiyevskiy,&#187; who has been avoiding authorities since 2014. In the GetContact app, some users saved Hudenko\u2019s number under tags like &#171;Valeriy Ukragro,&#187; &#171;Hudenko Valeriy Zakhidinkombank,&#187; and &#171;Valeriy Firtash.&#187;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volodymyr Tsyba, also <a href=\"https:\/\/kmkdka.radaadvokativ.com.ua\/reestr-advokativ-kieva\/advokat\/6995\">a lawyer<\/a>, was one of the founders of the legal firm Spero Lo Group. Until 2017, he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.work.ua\/resumes\/4198212\/\">worked<\/a> as chief legal counsel for Stroy Center LLC, where he specialized in preparing tender documentation. This company deals in grain, raw tobacco, seeds, animal feed, wholesale chemical products, and fuel retail. It also imports petroleum products from the Lithuanian firm Oilead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to tags in GetContact, Valeriy Hudenko also worked at Stroy Center. This might explain how Tsyba and Hudenko became acquainted with Irmantas Norkus, the Lithuanian businessman. Seeking to expand his operations from the Baltic states to Ukraine, Norkus entrusted the management of Pontem.UA to lawyers with years of experience handling business disputes for prominent players during the Yanukovych era. It seems Norkus had a clear strategy: he needed people who could help him secure tenders while managing complaints tied to the company&#8217;s questionable activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2024\\\/06\\\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-858&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2846,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:2378,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\" id=\"shemazvz\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"856\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-1024x856.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-858\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-1024x856.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-300x251.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-768x642.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-1536x1283.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719765885_scheme_pontem___1__-2048x1711.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leadership and Founder Connections of LLC &#171;Pontem.UA&#187;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"historypontem\"><strong>The History of Pontem: How Family Connections Secured Government Contracts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pontem&#8217;s operations in Lithuania date back to 1968 when it began as a small grocery store, Smulkaus urmo, in Vilnius. The store was established to supply food to institutions such as kindergartens, hospitals, and pioneer camps. In 1990, following the collapse of the USSR, Smulkus urmas became a state-owned enterprise, and by 1992, it was restructured into a private entity under the name Closed Joint-Stock Company Smulkus urmas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2000s, the company expanded into school catering and introduced the &#171;Myls&#187; brand to the market. Later, it became part of the &#171;ZIA Valda&#187; group, owned by Lithuanian businessman Gediminas \u017diemelis. \u017diemelis has been closely associated with key figures linked to russian president vladimir putin, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, Arkady Rotenberg, Ilgam Ragimov (a friend and former classmate of putin), and Artur Taymazov, a member of the russian state duma representing the party &#171;Yedinaya Rossiya&#187;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The father of ZIA Valda\u2019s main shareholder, Vidmantas \u017diemelis, served as a member of Lithuania\u2019s parliament. This position opened doors for Smulkus urmas, which, in May 2009, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.delfi.lt\/ru\/news\/live\/parlamentariev-budet-kormit-smulkus-urmas-21964525\">won<\/a> the contract to manage and operate the cafeteria, restaurant, buffet, and store in the Lithuanian Seimas (parliament). From there, success snowballed: within months, Smulkus urmas <a href=\"https:\/\/news.tts.lt\/%252525D1%25252583-%252525D1%25252581%252525D1%25252582%252525D0%252525B0%252525D0%252525BD%252525D1%25252586%252525D0%252525B8%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525BD%252525D0%252525BD%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525B9-%252525D1%25252581%252525D1%25252582%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525BB%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525B2%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525B9-%252525D0%252525BD%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525B2%252525D1%2525258B%252525D0%252525B9-%252525D1%25252585%252525D0%252525BE%252525D0%252525B7%252525D1%2525258F%252525D0%252525B8%252525D0%252525BD\/\">secured<\/a> a catering contract for the workers of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, followed by a series of tenders to provide meals for kindergartens, schools, hospitals, airlines, and major industrial facilities across Lithuania.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that Smulkus urmas realized early on that the key to market entry was through political offices rather than starting from the bottom. With the help of his father\u2019s influence, Gediminas \u017diemelis quickly positioned himself as a dominant player in Lithuania\u2019s catering industry, establishing a foothold in just two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2013, the company was involved in a tax evasion scandal. Perhaps to distance itself from the controversy, it <a href=\"https:\/\/ikontaktai.lt\/istorija\/smulkus-urmas-uab\/\">rebranded<\/a> as Closed Joint-Stock Company Pontem in January 2013. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lrt.lt\/naujienos\/lrt-tyrimai\/5\/239645\/lrt-tyrimas-skandalu-lydima-maisto-imperija-rysiai-veda-i-ministro-verygos-aplinka\">Lithuanian media<\/a>, the company owed much of its success in securing multimillion-euro contracts to the support of influential politician Juozas Bernatonis. In the fall of 2015, Irmantas Norkus acquired Pontem. Before this, Norkus had been a competitor in state catering contracts with his own company, Kretingos maistas. By merging these two major players under one umbrella, a true business giant emerged, capturing over 40% of Lithuania\u2019s public sector catering market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719705003_irmantas_norkus_.jpg\" alt=\"Irmantas Norkus, owner of CJSC Pontem\n\" class=\"wp-image-840\" style=\"width:630px;height:auto\" title=\"Irmantas Norkus, owner of CJSC Pontem\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719705003_irmantas_norkus_.jpg 800w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719705003_irmantas_norkus_-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719705003_irmantas_norkus_-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Irmantas Norkus, owner of CJSC Pontem, has exported his controversial business practices to Ukraine.

Irmantas Norkus\u2019s company, <a href=\"https:\/\/rekvizitai.vz.lt\/imone\/bruneros\/juridinis-asmuo\/\">Kretingos maitas<\/a>, faced allegations of fraud, large-scale asset misappropriation, and falsified accounting practices between 2014 and 2016. These activities reportedly caused losses exceeding \u20ac100,000 to the Lithuanian tax authorities. As a result, Norkus rebranded the company as <a href=\"https:\/\/rekvizitai.vz.lt\/imone\/bruneros\/juridinis-asmuo\/\">Bruneros<\/a>. However, this rebranding failed to stop Lithuanian regulators from uncovering additional violations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service classified more than half of Bruneros\u2019s kitchens and nearly a third of Pontem\u2019s kitchens as high-risk. Despite these concerns, both companies continued to secure significant state contracts. From 2015 to 2018 alone, Pontem and Bruneros signed deals with the Lithuanian government worth over \u20ac125 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lobisty\"><strong>How Lithuanian Minister Keruskaskas and Ukrainian President Poroshenko Became Advocates for a Controversial Business Venture<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This all took place in an EU country with strict antimonopoly regulations and robust anti-corruption policies. Now, think about how much simpler it is to work the public tender system in Ukraine \u2014 if you know the right people and strategies. That\u2019s where lawyers Valeriy Hudenko and Volodymyr Tsyba come in to help Irmantas Norkus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their tactic is simple but effective: if Pontem.UA doesn\u2019t win a tender or their application is rejected, the company\u2019s lawyers file numerous complaints with Ukraine\u2019s Antimonopoly Committee, forcing the tender to be canceled. This gives Pontem.UA another chance to join the new tender \u2014 this time with insider knowledge of competitors\u2019 prices and requirements. Initially, the Antimonopoly Committee dismissed Pontem.UA\u2019s complaints. But things changed when Lithuania\u2019s Minister Plenipotentiary to Ukraine, <a href=\"https:\/\/kz.mfa.lt\/almata\/ru\/o-nas\/konsul-jstbo\/general-jnjyj-konsul\">Gvidas Keru\u0161kauskas<\/a>, got involved. Alongside Irmantas Norkus, Keru\u0161kauskas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.go.poltava.ua\/esly-vlast-razreshyt-lytovtsy-nakormyat-shkolnykov-myrgoroda\/\">held meetings<\/a> with government officials and city mayors, promoting Pontem\u2019s &#171;innovative&#187; approaches to school and hospital catering. It\u2019s likely they also met with Antimonopoly Committee leadership, as shortly after Keru\u0161kauskas\u2019s visit, the committee began canceling tender decisions and allowing Pontem.UA back into the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy helped the company secure numerous education department contracts in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2016, just two months after it was registered, LLC Pontem.UA landed its first contract worth 5.1 million UAH from the Education Department of Kyiv&#8217;s Darnytskyi District. This opened the door for the company to quickly expand to other regions, including Mykolaiv, Kherson, Chernihiv, Myrhorod, Poltava, and Kremenchuk. In many cases, Pontem secured these contracts with the help of Ukraine\u2019s Antimonopoly Committee (AMCU).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Chernihiv, Pontem.UA was initially excluded from the competition due to errors in its documents. However, AMCU stepped in and forced the committee to let the company participate. A similar situation <a href=\"https:\/\/nashigroshi.org\/2018\/01\/24\/propiareni-poroshenkom-lytovtsi-oskarzhyly-zakupivlyu-shkilnoho-harchuvannya-v-poltavi-za-23-miljony\/\">happened<\/a> in Poltava, where Pontem\u2019s bid was rejected because it didn\u2019t include important documents, such as a sample school menu approved by the State Food and Consumer Service or proof of equipment ownership. Pontem filed a complaint, and AMCU ruled in its favor, canceling the entire process because other bidders also had mistakes in their applications. These disputes often left schools without meals. In Poltava and <a href=\"http:\/\/kievvlast.com.ua\/news\/shkolnye-stolovye-oboloni-mogut-ne-zarabotat-do-kontsa-maya-v-rga-predostavili-ofitsialnoe-obyasnenie\">Kyiv<\/a>, for instance, AMCU\u2019s decisions to cancel tenders led to delays in providing food to students. Pontem\u2019s method of using AMCU to get contracts caused more problems than solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"815\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_poltava_kharchyvannya.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-842\" style=\"width:479px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_poltava_kharchyvannya.png 625w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_poltava_kharchyvannya-230x300.png 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Parents in Poltava were notified that school meals could not be provided to their children due to the canceled tender following complaints filed by LLC Pontem.UA with the Antimonopoly Committee<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever LLC Pontem.UA faced resistance in tenders, complaints to the Antimonopoly Committee were used to clear the path for the Lithuanian company to secure contracts. In 2020, as <a href=\"https:\/\/nashigroshi.org\/2020\/07\/29\/pontem-vyhrav-58-mil-yoniv-na-kharchuvannia-uchniv-znisshy-komunal-nykiv-cherez-amku\/\">reported <\/a>by &#171;Nashi Hroshi,&#187; Pontem.UA removed its competitor, KP Promin of Sviatoshyn District Administration, in a tender worth 57.5 million UAH for school catering in Kyiv\u2019s Darnytsia district. The AMCU forced the tender committee to reject Promin\u2019s bid due to the absence of a document confirming ownership or lease of facilities\u2014a requirement often cited to reject Pontem.UA&#8217;s bids. In the end, Pontem.UA <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2020-04-06-001981-a\">won<\/a> the contract, barely surpassing its sole remaining competitor, Dnipro-based LLC Food-Cook, by a margin of just 8,000 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, an analysis of contracts awarded to Pontem.UA across Ukraine reveals a curious pattern: the company often wins tenders by offering a bid just a bit lower than its competitors \u2014 sometimes just a few hundred or even a single hryvnia. In Mykolaiv Oblast, Pontem beat its competitor, the Odesa-based company Olympia Service, with a bid that was exactly 1 UAH lower. Olympia Service alleged that local authorities in Mykolaiv were openly lobbying in favor of Pontem.UA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2018, then-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, for reasons best known to him, publicly supported LLC Pontem.UA during the Ukraine-Lithuania Business Forum. He praised the company for supposedly &#171;establishing a high-quality school catering system in Ukraine over the past two years.&#187; By that time, Pontem.UA had already secured 57 contracts worth a total of 190 million UAH \u2014 a dream scenario for a newcomer in the market. After receiving this presidential recognition, the company\u2019s path to landing more state contracts became even smoother and faster. After all, if the president himself backs a company, how could tender committees possibly object?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember the strategy of entering markets from the top down, rather than building from the bottom up? It seems that after succeeding with this approach in Lithuania, Pontem has managed to replicate it in Ukraine \u2014 and perhaps beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prmmoldovy\"><strong>How a Meeting with Moldova&#8217;s Prime Minister Secured Pontem a 150 Million Leu Contract<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2018, the Lithuanian company JSC Pontem expanded into Moldova, establishing its subsidiary, <a href=\"https:\/\/b2bhint.com\/ru\/company\/md\/pontemx-srl--1018600050502\">Pontem.

But we\u2019ll overcome it through quality. I\u2019m confident this project will succeed and expand nationwide.&#187;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What promises Irmantas Norkus made to the Ukrainian president and Moldovan prime minister in exchange for their high-level lobbying of his business remains unclear. However, while Poroshenko and Filip praised the exceptional quality of Pontem&#8217;s catering to their citizens, Norkus\u2019s enterprise was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.delfi.lt\/ru\/news\/economy\/zavravshayasya-kompaniya-pontem-po-prezhnemu-pobezhdaet-v-konkursah-seychas-postavlyaet-moloko-detyam-80253769\">blacklisted<\/a> in Lithuania for supplying schools with substandard milk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ukraine, the scenario is completely different: no blacklists for violations, no accountability. This is despite numerous complaints from parents and even officials about Pontem.UA\u2019s operations over the years\u2014enough to fill several &#171;blacklists&#187;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"portrudzakon\"><strong>Pontem.UA Systematically Violates Labor Laws: Former Employees Speak Out<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many former employees of Pontem.UA report frequent delays in salary payments or even complete non-payment, as well as unofficial employment practices. This, unfortunately, comes as no surprise. All the talk about a foreign company entering Ukraine to improve processes and significantly raise the quality of school and hospital catering is, in reality, a fiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Pontem.UA entered the Ukrainian market, it didn\u2019t hire its own staff of new cooks, invest in its own equipment, or establish its own network of suppliers. Its primary goal was to win tenders \u2014 a task that former lawyers of Firtash have been very good at to this day. Once the tender is secured, Pontem changes nothing in the kitchens of schools or kindergartens. Instead, the existing cooks who worked under a different company simply &#171;switch over&#187; to work for Norkus\u2019s firm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pontem.UA reportedly hires only part of the necessary staff, and even then, not all of them are officially employed, likely to avoid paying taxes. Unofficial employees are often left without pay entirely, as many former workers claim. One review says:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t officially hire staff, they trick employees, delay promised wages, or don\u2019t pay them at all. They force you to work overtime and on weekends without any compensation. In the end, you work 17-hour days without breaks, and then you don\u2019t even get paid\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such practices, any claims about improving quality are hard to believe. In fact, these conditions likely make things worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another review from September 2021 states: \u201cThis company is shit. They immediately cut staff wherever they operate! Of course, they\u2019d rather line their pockets by working with fewer people \u2014 just one cook preparing meals for 200 kids&#187;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2024\\\/06\\\/cleaned1719764870_prats_vidguku.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-full is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-849&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:639px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:941,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:816,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"941\" height=\"816\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719764870_prats_vidguku.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-849\" style=\"width:639px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719764870_prats_vidguku.png 941w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719764870_prats_vidguku-300x260.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719764870_prats_vidguku-768x666.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Former employees of Pontem.UA rarely leave positive reviews about their experience working for the company on feedback websites<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sustemskargu\"><strong>Pontem.UA Feeds Ukrainian Children Poor-Quality Meals: Complaints Keep Coming<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost immediately after Pontem.UA began winning education department tenders in Kyiv districts, complaints from parents and officials started coming in. The first issues were reported in the Solomianskyi district. After the company won a tender with the lowest bid of just 7 UAH per school breakfast, it became clear that Pontem <a href=\"http:\/\/kievvlast.com.ua\/news\/solomenskaya-rga-obratilas-v-prokuraturu-s-trebovaniem-razobratsya-s-nedobrosovestnym-postavshhikom-shkolnogo-pitaniya-video\">lacked the resources<\/a> to provide meals for schools. As a result, children were left without food, prompting the Solomianskyi District Administration to escalate the matter to the prosecutor\u2019s office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, the State Consumer Service conducted inspections of meal quality in Kyiv schools and kindergartens. Not surprisingly, the highest number of violations were found in districts where Pontem.UA operated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#171;Just in the past month, Pontem.UA was found breaking numerous rules and regulations in providing children&#8217;s meals. Some of the issues recorded include violations in technological processes, improper storage of raw vegetables, meat, and fish, inadequate washing procedures, and more,&#187; <a href=\"https:\/\/kievvlast.com.ua\/news\/skandalnoe-ooo-pontemua-poluchilo-eshhe-odin-podryad-na-obespechenie-pitaniya-shkolnikov-vyshgorodskogo-rajona?noredirect=true\">stated<\/a> Oleg Ruban, Head of the State Consumer Service in Kyiv. He added that laboratory tests confirmed these violations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, neither appeals to the prosecutor\u2019s office nor promises to terminate contracts made a difference. Pontem continued to win tenders, and complaints kept coming in. Parents of kids at the Kyivska Rus gymnasium in Osokorky, after hearing constant complaints from their children about school meals, decided to inspect the cafeteria and kitchen themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#171;We saw some strange pickled products, inedible zucchini spread, black buckwheat that no one could swallow, and unidentified butter,&#187; a parent involved in the inspection <a href=\"https:\/\/lb.ua\/society\/2021\/01\/28\/476318_byudzhetniy_snidanok_hto_vigraie.html\">told<\/a> the <em>Left Bank<\/em> publication. They also discovered a lack of staff in the kitchen, with those present working without health permits and serving underweight portions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#171;To say the food was awful is an understatement! Rotten products, rock-hard bread rolls, it was horrifying! And this was being fed to kids, some of whom can barely chew properly,&#187; wrote a user on a company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vnutri.org\/pontem-ua\/\">review site<\/a> in January 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2024\\\/06\\\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-851&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:639px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1554,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:436,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"287\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua-1024x287.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-851\" style=\"width:639px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua-1024x287.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua-300x84.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua-768x215.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua-1536x431.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/cleaned1719728217_vidguk_na_robotu_pontemua.png 1554w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A review of Pontem.UA&#8217;s services in educational institutions<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2019, Kyiv resident Maryna Rassolova <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1447547535497898\/posts\/2412034009049241\/\">shared<\/a> photos in the &#171;Parents SOS&#187; Facebook group showing the meals served to students at School No. 332 in Kyiv&#8217;s Darnytskyi district, where her child studies.

In 2022, the company earned 32 million UAH from tenders, which increased to 125 million UAH in 2023. By mid-2024, the total had already reached half a billion UAH.

However, Hudenko made a big mistake during the bidding process, submitting a final price of 10 million UAH instead of 950 million UAH in the second round, leading to Pontem.UA\u2019s disqualification. Even without the mistake, they had little chance of winning \u2014 competitors had already offered prices 200 million UAH lower. Regardless, it\u2019s clear that if not today, then soon enough, \u201crock-hard buns\u201d and scraps from the trash might end up on the plates of Ukraine\u2019s defenders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\u2019t forget passengers of Ukrzaliznytsia\u2019s Intercity trains. Guess who managed to push out WOG from providing food services there? That\u2019s right \u2014 Pontem.UA, once again helped by the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine.

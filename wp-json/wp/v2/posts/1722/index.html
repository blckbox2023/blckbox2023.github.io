Among them is Yurii Kharon (also known as Hedeon), a former bishop of the Moscow Patriarchate\u2019s Kyiv Diocese who fled to russia, and his longtime business partner Mykhailo Hoikhman, who remains in Ukraine to this day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back under Yanukovych\u2019s regime, the two illegally built a \u201cchurch tent\u201d on the grounds of a protected UNESCO heritage site in central Kyiv, right near the ruins of the historic Tithe Church. That tent eventually turned into a permanent structure where pro-russian propaganda was regularly preached during services \u2014 earning the place a reputation as an \u201cFSB hub\u201d. While that illegal structure has since been demolished, Kharon and Hoikhman still own significant assets in Ukraine, as this report reveals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kharon1\"><strong>Who Is Yurii Kharon and How He Seized Land in Central Kyiv<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yurii Samuilovych Kharon, now 65 years old, was born in Odesa. After serving in the Soviet army, he became a psalm-reader at the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Luhansk. He later moved to the Kursk Diocese, where in 1987 he became a monk and received the name Hedeon. In 1988, he joined the Omsk Diocese and served there until 1989, then moved to Tyumen. In 1991, he immigrated to the United States, where he became a Navy chaplain and served in various churches. He returned to Ukraine in 1999, joined the Kyiv Diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate, and in 2005 was appointed head of the Tithe Church in Kyiv.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2004, Bishop Hedeon illegally installed a large tent on the territory of a national historical reserve in Kyiv, disguising it as a church. The tent stood untouched for several years. Likely taking advantage of the fact that few people are willing to confront the church directly, the tent was gradually replaced \u2014 first by a wooden chapel, and later by a permanent structure with a full foundation. All of this happened on land protected by UNESCO, where any kind of construction is strictly prohibited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011059_nezakonna_cerkva_bilya_desyatynnogo_khramu_v_kyyivi-1024x602.png\" alt=\"Plastic tent, wooden chapel, and a full-scale brick-and-mortar church\" class=\"wp-image-1635\" style=\"width:660px;height:auto\" title=\"Plastic tent, wooden chapel, and a full-scale brick-and-mortar church\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011059_nezakonna_cerkva_bilya_desyatynnogo_khramu_v_kyyivi-1024x602.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011059_nezakonna_cerkva_bilya_desyatynnogo_khramu_v_kyyivi-300x176.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011059_nezakonna_cerkva_bilya_desyatynnogo_khramu_v_kyyivi-768x451.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011059_nezakonna_cerkva_bilya_desyatynnogo_khramu_v_kyyivi.png 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Evolution of Yurii Kharon\u2019s illegal church at the national heritage site \u2014 from a tent to a permanent structure<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, with the help of his business associate Olena Paliukh \u2014 who at the time was a parliamentary candidate from Natalia Korolevska\u2019s \u201dUkraina \u2013 Vpered!\u201d (Ukraine \u2013 Forward!) party \u2014 Yurii Kharon managed to legalize his illegal church near the foundation of the historic Tithe Church through a court decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, Paliukh filed a lawsuit, presenting herself as an \u201cinvestor\u201d and claiming that she had allegedly built the structure now used by the religious community. The court avoided going against the church and ruled in favor of Paliukh and Kharon, officially recognizing the 60-square-meter structure as legitimate. On paper, it was recorded as \u201cthree trade kiosks, each 20 square meters.\u201d A year and a half later, a state registrar amended the property records, increasing the size to 133 square meters. This is how Yurii Kharon not only built the church illegally, but then unilaterally declared himself abbot of the Tithe Monastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This continued until May 2024, when the so-called \u201cchurch kiosk\u201d of the Moscow Patriarchate was finally <a href=\"https:\/\/df.news\/2024\/05\/18\/istoriia-khramu-mafu-na-fundamenti-desiatynnoi-tserkvy-sakralna-zhertva-chy-provokatsiia\/\">dismantled<\/a> by court order. Kharon himself had already fled Ukraine for russia at the start of the full-scale invasion. On January 25, 2025, a Mercedes-Benz with Ukrainian license plate KA2094SN and a pro-war Z symbol \u2014 used to mark russian aggression against Ukraine \u2014 was spotted in moscow.

From 2007 to 2014, Kharon served as an assistant to Member of Parliament Yurii Miroshnychenko from the Party of Regions. Miroshnychenko was then the official representative of President Yanukovych in the Verkhovna Rada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, Kharon also co-founded a group called \u201cVirne Kozatstvo\u201d (\u201cFaithful Cossacks\u201d). Members of this organization participated in the Anti-Maidan movement, and after the Revolution of Dignity, some of them went on to fight against Ukraine in Donetsk and Luhansk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2008, Kharon has been a citizen of the russian federation. According to \u201dUkrainska Pravda\u201d, he received his most recent russian international passport on January 16, 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/04\\\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1637&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:681px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1270,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:700,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"564\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona-1024x564.png\" alt=\"Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon\" class=\"wp-image-1637\" style=\"width:681px;height:auto\" title=\"Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona-1024x564.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona-300x165.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona-768x423.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744011082_rosiyskiy_pasport_yuriya_kharona.png 1270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Extract from russian records confirming russian citizenship of Yurii Samuilovych Kharon<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He has long been one of the loudest voices of russian propaganda in Ukraine and abroad.

Hedeon) has faced in Ukraine is the loss of his Ukrainian citizenship. And even that happened only on the second attempt. The first attempt came in 2018, when the State Migration Service of Ukraine canceled the decision that granted Kharon Ukrainian citizenship back on April 30, 2011. In February 2019, border guards detained Hedeon at Boryspil Airport due to his multiple citizenships \u2014 Ukrainian, russian, and American \u2014 and denied him entry to Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on September 18, 2019, the Kyiv District Administrative Court <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/84329904\" rel=\"nofollow\">ordered<\/a> the State Migration Service to restore his Ukrainian citizenship. Neither <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/87203438\" rel=\"nofollow\">appeals<\/a> nor <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/88655328\" rel=\"nofollow\">cassation<\/a> helped \u2014 all courts sided with the pro-russian priest.

According to official Ukrainian registries, Yurii Kharon still holds a 474 m\u00b2 plot of land in the village of Shpytkivka, near Kyiv, where one hundred square meters can <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-zemlya-selskohozyaystvennogo-naznacheniya-gorenka-sadovaya-ulitsa-32003655.html\">cost<\/a> up to $5,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also owns a 70.1 m\u00b2 apartment in Kyiv at 14-A Verkhogliada Street, unit 235\/2, located in the upscale residential complex \u201cNovopecherski Lypky.\u201d Its <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/prodazha-kvartir\/kiev-ul-dragomyrova-zdanie-14a\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">market value<\/a> is approximately $190,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kharon has another apartment in Odesa at 4 Cherniakhovskoho Street, unit 12, worth at least $60,000. He also owns a parking spot there, which <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/prodazha-garazhei\/odessa-parking\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">could cost<\/a> over $13,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for vehicles, Hedeon owns two: the black 2021 Mercedes-Benz V 220 CDI spotted in moscow bearing the pro-war \u201cZ\u201d symbol \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_mercedes_benz_v_class_37107133.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">worth<\/a> no less than $60,000 \u2014 and a black 2008 Porsche Cayenne <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/car\/porsche\/cayenne\/year\/2008\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">valued<\/a> at around $12,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the fugitive priest Yurii Kharon still holds assets in Ukraine worth at least $360,000. And all of them remain untouched, while he continues living freely in russia, publicly supporting the war and helping putin\u2019s regime brainwash the russian public into backing the invasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kharon4\"><strong>How Mykhailo Hoikhman, Kharon\u2019s Partner, Was Behind \u201cTitushky\u201d at the Anti-Maidan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite fleeing to russia, Kharon left behind not only his Ukrainian real estate but also a close business partner \u2014 Mykhailo Hoikhman, another figure with a long and controversial history. Hoikhman was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.depo.ua\/rus\/politics\/sproba-pidpalu-sarayu-upc-mp-na-desyatinniy-chomu-klichko-maye-vzyati-pidpalyuvachiv-na-poruki-20180129717392\" rel=\"nofollow\">known<\/a> as a key financier of Yanukovych\u2019s inner circle. He helped launder money for the regime and was reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/politeka.net\/uk\/news\/politics\/961782-ne-tolko-gladkovskij-novoe-skandalnoe-rassledovanie-o-korrupcii-v-oboronke\" rel=\"nofollow\">responsible<\/a> for funding <em>titushky<\/em> \u2014 paid thugs used to violently disperse protesters during the Euromaidan revolution. Strangely, Hoikhman managed to stay under the radar of both law enforcement and the media. That allowed him to remain in Ukraine and continue his operations after Yanukovych fled the country and his regime collapsed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2010, Hoikhman has led the Independent Association of Ukrainian Collection Agencies \u2014 an industry largely unregulated by Ukrainian law. In 2012, he became an advisor to Serhii Arbuzov, the then-head of the National Bank and a close Yanukovych ally. That role opened doors for Hoikhman to sit on the supervisory boards of three banks: Erste Bank, Kyivska Rus, and FidoBank. The latter two were eventually liquidated and became subjects of criminal investigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2012, Hoikhman co-founded the &#171;Revival of the Desiatynna Church Fund&#187; along with Yurii Kharon and Olena Paliukh \u2014 the same woman who had helped Kharon legalize his illegal church structure. The fund was likely used to collect donations from Moscow Patriarchate parishioners. During Euromaidan, Hoikhman, who helped organize titushky, <a href=\"https:\/\/politeka.net\/uk\/news\/politics\/961782-ne-tolko-gladkovskij-novoe-skandalnoe-rassledovanie-o-korrupcii-v-oboronke\" rel=\"nofollow\">used<\/a> them to guard the illegal church building from protesters demanding its demolition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fund still exists today. According to official records, its founders remain Yurii Kharon \u2014 now in russia \u2014 and Mykhailo Hoikhman, the former shadow financier of the Yanukovych regime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kharon5\"><strong>Which Ukrainian Businessmen Are Linked to Kharon and Hoikhman<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Mykhailo Hoikhman remains listed as a founder and beneficiary of eight Ukrainian companies: Logistek LLC, Hermetik Home LLC, NTC Ukrnaftokhim LLC, Marshal-Tour LLC (registered in russian-occupied Yalta), the previously mentioned Desiatynna Church Revival Fund, as well as Klym LLC and the Platinum House housing cooperative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last two are worth a closer look. Klym LLC is registered in the elite village of Kozyn near Kyiv. Its official business activity is listed as &#171;comprehensive property management.&#187;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoikhman holds a 1.64% stake in this company.

Arms production dropped by 57% year to year, export volumes fell, and profits dropped by nearly half. Hlushchenko has also been linked to corrupt schemes involving Ihor Hladkovskyi and has lobbied for his own interests in military procurement. Not surprisingly, he has close ties with Yurii Kharon, who publicly <a href=\"https:\/\/politeka.net\/uk\/news\/politics\/961782-ne-tolko-gladkovskij-novoe-skandalnoe-rassledovanie-o-korrupcii-v-oboronke\" rel=\"nofollow\">calls<\/a> Hlushchenko a friend. Until November 20, 2021, the list of founders of Platinum House also included Olena Paliukh \u2014 the same partner of Kharon and Hoikhman involved in the illegal land grab in central Kyiv to build the unauthorized UOC-MP church.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unfinished townhouses in this part of Odesa are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.olx.ua\/d\/uk\/obyavlenie\/na-fontanskoy-doroge-dom-s-uchastkom-IDXkVzn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated<\/a> to be worth at least $2.1 million.

This makes the land itself worth at least $3.1 million. Combined, the total value of the Odesa property tied to Hoikhman and his family may exceed $5 million. If sold, that\u2019s how much his inner circle could pocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s not all. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Hoikhman also owns a residential house in Kozyn, near Kyiv, measuring 153 square meters, with a plot of nearly 700 square meters and a garage.

Each is over 250 square meters in size and worth at least $160,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoikhman also owns half of a customs-licensed warehouse (A-IV) in Boryspil with an area of 5,710 square meters, plus a boiler house and transformer station (B-1) totaling 273 square meters. Warehouses of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.olx.ua\/d\/uk\/obyavlenie\/prodam-farmatsevticheskiy-sklad-IDR7U40.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar<\/a> size in Boryspil sell for over UAH 145 million \u2014 about $3.5 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Altogether, a conservative estimate puts Hoikhman\u2019s personal assets in Ukraine at over $4.15 million.

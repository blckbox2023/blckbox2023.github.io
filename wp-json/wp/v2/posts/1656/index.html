In the past few years, new owners in this complex include Nadiia Orekhovska, Petro Hyrych, Tetyana Kicha, Yevhen Orlov, Larysa Nadeiena, Oksana Petliovana, Illia Brekhin, and Svitlana Hubar. You might wonder \u2014 who are these people? And how can they afford such expensive real estate during wartime?

It has 574 apartments. Prices range from $200,000 (without renovations) to $1 million (fully furnished). Residents get access to private schools, kindergartens, a luxury mall, and swimming pools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So who are the people buying luxury homes in the middle of a war?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apartment \u2116337. How Pensioner Nadiia Orekhovska from a Village Near Kyiv Bought 90 m\u00b2 in a Luxury Tower<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/publichni-rozsliduvannya\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">get acquainted<\/a>. Nadiia Orekhovska is a 75-year-old pensioner who, until recently, lived in a small apartment in a typical panel building in the town of Kalynivka near Kyiv. In February 2025, she purchased apartment No. 337 in Taryan Towers \u2014 a 90.7 square meter unit. The price of such an apartment ranges from \u20b412,490,000 (about $302,420) without renovation to \u20b428,230,375 (<a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/flats-sale\/view\/11757383\/?utm_term=2542884659&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_campaign=external_rank_1296\" rel=\"nofollow\">$680,250<\/a>) fully finished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orekhovska doesn\u2019t own any companies, isn\u2019t involved in any business, and there\u2019s no public information about her online. According to Ukraine\u2019s property register, this is her only known asset. A retired woman buying a luxury apartment for tens of millions of hryvnias? Sounds suspicious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s very likely that Nadiia Orekhovska is simply a front \u2014 a person used to register expensive real estate in order to legalize money with no official origin. So, whose money is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her husband, 77-year-old Volodymyr Orekhovskyi, is also a pensioner, registered at the same address in Kalynivka. Their daughter, 54-year-old Tetyana Hyrych, has been registered as a sole proprietor since 2009. Her declared business activity is renting out property \u2014 either owned or leased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orekhovska\u2019s son-in-law, 61-year-old Petro Hyrych, was registered in 2021 in the village of Danylivka, Vasylkivskyi district, Kyiv region. One of his phone numbers appears in GetContact with the tag \u201cLife Hyrych Ukrsibbank,\u201d which may suggest he once worked at Ukrsibbank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Petro Hyrych is the founder and beneficiary of Promtekhservis LLC, a company that sells agricultural equipment and auto parts. His 34-year-old son, Maksym Hyrych, is listed as the director. The company frequently wins state tenders: in 2022 it received \u20b49.3 million, in 2023 \u2014 \u20b465.4 million, and in 2024 \u2014 an impressive \u20b4157.8 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"214\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis-1024x214.png\" alt=\"Promtekhservis LLC won government contracts \" class=\"wp-image-1554\" title=\"Promtekhservis LLC won government contracts \" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis-1024x214.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis-300x63.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis-768x160.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis-1536x321.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160491_tendery_promtechservis.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>During the war years, TG Promtekhservis LLC won government contracts totaling \u20b4235,866,503 ($6,040,115).

For instance, in the fall of 2024, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/tenders\/UA-2024-10-25-013753-a\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold<\/a> a 6&#215;4 truck crane to military unit T0200 for \u20b48.6 million, and another to unit T0300 for <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/tenders\/UA-2024-10-25-004152-a\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u20b49.35 million<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hyrych family owns several apartments and parking spots in Kyiv, along with four premium-class cars \u2014 Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and BMW \u2014 each worth between $40,000 and $60,000. In 2024 alone, Petro Hyrych\u2019s sons, Maksym and Andrii, purchased two of those cars, spending a total of $135,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Petro Hyrych\u2019s younger son, Andrii, also owns an apartment in Taryan Towers \u2014 right next to his grandmother\u2019s. He has unit No. 336, while she owns No. 337. According to official records, Andrii received the apartment as a gift on February 21, 2024. The person who gifted it was his grandfather, Volodymyr Orekhovskyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The apartment, which is 90.5 square meters, was valued at \u20b43.9 million (about $95,700), which is nearly four times cheaper than the neighboring unit of the same size purchased by Nadiia Orekhovska. Most likely, the grandfather and grandson agreed to report a lower price to reduce the amount of taxes owed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1555\" style=\"width:693px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160428_optimize-1-tar-graph.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The owner of the apartment with an area of \u200b\u200b90.7 square meters and a value of UAH 12.5 million-75-year-old pensioner Nadiya Orekhovskaya.

That\u2019s why anti-corruption agencies should seriously look into how pensioners from the small town of Kalynivka could afford some of the most expensive real estate in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apartment \u2116291. How the Mother of Bribe-Taking Lawyer Andrii Kicha Bought a Taryan Towers Apartment a Year After His Dismissal<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2025, Apartment No. 291 in Taryan Towers \u2014 82.3 square meters \u2014 was purchased by 68-year-old retiree Tetyana Kicha. She is a former <a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/person\/b37c7a3243fc20c7c28204c704cbb396\" rel=\"nofollow\">assistant<\/a> to Andrii Pyshnyi, who used to be an MP and is now the head of the National Bank of Ukraine.

It&#8217;s hard to believe that a former assistant\u2019s salary could cover such a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Tetyana Kicha does run a business. Since October 2021, she has been the founder, beneficiary, and director of TOV \u201cTatio Consulting,\u201d a company dealing with real estate buying and selling.

The only public information about her is that she owns a 15.17% share in a company called \u201cAlina,\u201d which operates in the beauty salon business. It&#8217;s hard to believe that a small stake in a hair and beauty company could earn enough to buy four luxury apartments in one of the most expensive buildings in Ukraine \u2014 especially since the company has never filed any financial reports with the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larysa\u2019s husband, 73-year-old Dmytro Nadiyen, does not appear to own any businesses. The only hint about his background comes from how his phone number is saved in the Getcontact app \u2014 as \u201cDmytro Hryhorovych STO.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their son, Oleksii Nadiyen, owns a small 4.17% share in a company called \u201cNVN Dnipro,\u201d which rents out real estate. But this company also shows no official <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/c\/39624027\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial activity<\/a>. Oleksii is also the founder and director of \u201cAlex Group Agro Trading,\u201d a company involved in the wholesale trade of grain, tobacco, seeds, and animal feed. In 2023, the company made a net profit of 29.5 million UAH, and in 2024 \u2014 3.7 million UAH. That\u2019s still far less than what was spent on the apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleksii is also linked to another company, \u201cSalon Valentyna LTD,\u201d which is also in the beauty business. However, this company made only 200 UAH profit in 2023 and 400 UAH in 2024. He is also listed as the director of \u201cTelnet Corp,\u201d a company that hasn\u2019t made any profit since 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1561\" style=\"width:708px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160445_optimize-4-tar-graph.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The owner of the beauty salon Larisa Nadiene bought four apartments at Taryan Towers for more than $ 1 million.

The conclusion seems obvious: the apartments were likely purchased using illegal income \u2014 either from the Nadiyen family themselves or on behalf of other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apartment \u2116298.

Most likely, Olena is a regular pharmacist or pharmacy assistant. She doesn\u2019t own any shares in a business, according to official records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for her husband, Zinoviy Petliovanyi \u2014 he has no registered business or private enterprise.

A 28-Year-Old Draft Dodger Illia Brekhin Gifted a Luxury Apartment to His 80-Year-Old Grandpa<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>28-year-old Illia Brekhin, originally from Dnipro, appears to have lived and studied in London at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GoldsmithsUoL\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goldsmiths<\/a>, University of London, according to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/illyabr?locale=ru_RU\" rel=\"nofollow\">social media<\/a>. On September 15, 2020, he bought not one, but two apartments in Taryan Towers \u2014 apartment No. 373 with 119 square meters, and apartment No. 380 with 118.7 square meters. Each of these would cost at least \u20b417.6 million (around $460,000) without renovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, on September 2, 2024, Illia Brekhin gave both apartments to his grandfather, Mykola Lysak, as a gift. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, both gift agreements listed the value of each apartment as only \u20b42 million (around $49,000) \u2014 nearly 9 times lower than their actual market price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These documents were signed not by Brekhin himself, but by Iryna Porokh, who acted under a power of attorney issued in Warsaw by Polish notary Dorota Kossiewska. This confirms that Illia Brekhin is currently abroad during wartime in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So who is this young man casually giving his grandfather tens of millions of hryvnias worth of property? According to public records, Brekhin owns 35% of PJSC \u201cDnipro Terminal,\u201d where his grandfather Mykola Lysak is also a co-founder. However, the company\u2019s financial <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/c\/32851024\" rel=\"nofollow\">report<\/a> for 2020 shows that it was operating at a loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"233\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist-1024x233.png\" alt=\"The most recent financial report from PJSC &quot;Dnipro Terminal&quot; was submitted back in 2020\" class=\"wp-image-1563\" title=\"The most recent financial report from PJSC &quot;Dnipro Terminal&quot; was submitted back in 2020\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist-1024x233.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist-300x68.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist-768x175.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist-1536x349.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160496_tov_dniprovskii_terminal_zvitnist.png 1558w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The most recent financial report from PJSC &#171;Dnipro Terminal&#187; was submitted back in 2020<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So clearly, the Dnipro-based business isn&#8217;t the source of funds that could cover two apartments in the most expensive residential complex in Kyiv.

It\u2019s clear this was done to avoid paying full taxes \u2014 taxes that are especially vital for a country fighting for its survival against russian aggression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apartment \u2116323. How Crypto Trader Andrii Trushkovskyi Used a Pensioner from Donetsk Region to Hide His Illegal Profits from the State<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another apartment owner at Taryan Towers who raises serious questions is 76-year-old pensioner Svitlana Hubar, registered in the town of Dobropillia, Donetsk region. On January 27, 2025, she became the official owner of Apartment #323, which is 82.1 square meters in size and worth at least $300,000 \u2014 and <a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/flats-sale\/view\/11757383\/?utm_term=2542884659&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_campaign=external_rank_1296\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to<\/a> $615,000 if fully renovated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, in the sale agreement, the seller was Iryna Trushkovska, and the buyer was Svitlana Hubar. But she was represented under power of attorney by her grandson Dmytro Mustafayev. The price listed in the agreement was just $107,740 \u2014 about three times lower than the market value (assuming it was an unfurnished unit). Once again, this appears to be a classic case of undervaluing the transaction \u2014 likely to minimize taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even at the reduced price, Svitlana Hubar has no legal income or business ownership that would explain such a purchase. Neither does her husband, 77-year-old pensioner Ivan Hubar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their daughter, 53-year-old Anzhela Mustafayeva, likely works as a school cleaner in Dobropillia. Her mobile number is saved in others\u2019 phones (via GetContact) under names like \u201cAnzhela 7 Shk,\u201d \u201cAnzhela Cleaner,\u201d and \u201cAnzhela Janitor.\u201d Her husband, Server Mustafayev, is also not listed as a business owner or individual entrepreneur in any official registry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their sons \u2014 24-year-old Oleksandr Mustafayev and 30-year-old Dmytro Mustafayev \u2014 are both registered as sole proprietors. Oleksandr works in computer programming since 2021, and Dmytro provides information services since 2020. Neither shows signs of major financial success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, this is an ordinary family from Donetsk region \u2014 not the type that can afford luxury real estate worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. For them, a Taryan Towers apartment is more of a dream than a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the only potential lead is the seller of the apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>65-year-old Iryna Trushkovska, a resident of Kyiv, is listed in GetContact as an accountant. Since 2018, she has been the head of a civic group called \u201cSokil Gardening Society.\u201d Comments she made on Facebook suggest that, as of 2017, she wasn\u2019t employed and was receiving caregiver assistance for her mother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"543\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160422_facebook_iryna_trushkovska-543x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1566\" style=\"width:450px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160422_facebook_iryna_trushkovska-543x1024.png 543w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160422_facebook_iryna_trushkovska-159x300.png 159w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160422_facebook_iryna_trushkovska.png 544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Iryna Trushkovska, who sold the apartment in Taryan Towers, was recently unemployed as she was caring for her sick mother<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before selling the apartment to Svitlana Hubar, Iryna Trushkovska had received it as a gift from her younger son, Andrii Trushkovskyi, who lives in Los Angeles, USA. In the gift agreement, the value of the Taryan Towers apartment was listed at just $9,800 (around 400,000 UAH) \u2014 about 30 times less than its real market value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrii Trushkovskyi, 35, is a co-founder and shareholder (49%) of a film and TV production company called Red Panda Production, established in 2017. However, the company has never filed financial reports. He\u2019s also listed as a co-founder and signatory of an advertising agency called Maincream, which reported losses in 2020 and hasn\u2019t filed <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/c\/41285152\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports<\/a> since. These companies appear to be inactive or fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where did he get the money to buy an apartment in one of the most expensive buildings in Ukraine? Judging by his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/trutrdr\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram<\/a>, Trushkovskyi is involved in crypto trading \u2014 just like another figure from our past investigations, <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/vladyslav-myroshnychenko-how-a-hookah-specialist-from-kharkiv-became-a-crypto-expert-and-a-dollar-millionaire-evading-taxes\/\">Vladyslav Myroshnychenko from Kharkiv<\/a>. Trushkovskyi lives a luxurious lifestyle: he drives expensive cars, travels abroad, wears designer brands and luxury watches. His younger brother, Timur Trushkovskyi, also lives in the US and does crypto trading and training \u2014 though he\u2019s not officially linked to any registered businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither Andrii nor his brother nor their parents have legitimate, legal income large enough to afford a Taryan Towers apartment. The companies linked to Andrii generate no profits and seem to exist only on paper. Most likely, he made large profits from crypto trading and used the apartment purchase to legalize those funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why did Trushkovskyi gift the apartment to his mother in May 2024, declaring its value as only $9,800, and then she sold it in January 2025 for $107,000 to a pensioner from a front-line town in Donetsk region?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably because in May 2024, the Economic Security Bureau searched an apartment in <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/hto-v-taryan-towers-zhyve-yak-vlasnyky-kvartyr-v-najdorozhchomu-budynku-krayiny-legalizovuyut-nezakonni-prybutky\">Taryan Towers<\/a> belonging to blogger and Traffik Devils CEO Oleksandr Slobozhenko, who was under investigation for hiding crypto profits from taxes. Fearing he might be next, Trushkovskyi likely rushed to transfer the property to his mother. Later, the apartment was sold again \u2014 this time to a pensioner, likely to further hide its real ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1567\" style=\"width:703px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/cleaned1742160461_optimize-7-tar-graph.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The cryptotrator Andriy Trushkovsky does not have official income for buying an apartment at Taryan Towers, so he has made it for a false person.

It\u2019s about regional operators \u2014 local fixers, working hand in hand with municipal officials to drain defense budgets while the country\u2019s attention is focused elsewhere.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And that\u2019s exactly why the case of Dmytro Shlimovych from Ivano-Frankivsk matters. Because it shows a pattern: he is not an exception. There are likely not dozens, but hundreds or even thousands of such petty crooks across Ukraine. And together, their schemes may be causing more damage to the country at war than the high-profile scandals investigated by NABU.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stealing during wartime became much easier after the Cabinet of Ministers adopted <a href=\"https:\/\/zakon.rada.gov.ua\/laws\/show\/1178-2022-%25D0%25BF\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Resolution<\/a> No. 1178 on October 12, 2022. This decree approved \u201cspecial procedures for public procurement of goods, works, and services\u201d during martial law and 90 days after it ends. In practice, it opened the door for every state institution and local authority to bypass competition and carry out purchases in the shortest possible time. The logic was simple: the army needs supplies fast, without the delays of lengthy tenders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But predictably, corrupt officials and businessmen rushed to exploit these rules. Especially when they gained access to hundreds of millions of hryvnias allocated for defense programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if1\"><strong>How Money Laundering Thrives in the Regions Through the State Program \u201cDefense of Ukraine\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 2024 the government decided to prepare children for war by introducing a new subject in schools and vocational colleges called \u201cDefense of Ukraine\u201d. Pilot centers were created in several regions, with dozens of schools being re-equipped with modern technology, so students could practice military skills. For this purpose, the government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kmu.gov.ua\/npas\/deiaki-pytannia-nadannia-osvitnoi-subventsii-z-derzhavnoho-biudzhetu-mistsevym-biudzhetam-za-spetsialnym-fondom-derzhavnoho-biudzhetu-dlia-zabezpechennia-i271223-1374\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">allocated<\/a> \u20b41.65 billion in subsidies to the regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ivano-Frankivsk region, 64 such centers were established \u2014 in 53 lyceums and 11 vocational schools. They were provided with equipment worth more than \u20b496.4 million. According to DOZORRO Transparency International Ukraine, this was the third-largest amount spent nationwide (after Kyiv and Lviv region) to teach children the basics of warfare. The bulk of the money in Ivano-Frankivsk was funneled through just three procurements by the regional Department of Education and Science, almost all of it going to a little-known local company, Optomix LLC, created only shortly before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company was registered on April 4, 2024, with a charter capital of just \u20b410,000. Yet by November of the same year, it had already landed its first major contract, supplying an <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-10-25-011107-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">interactive laser shooting range<\/a> worth more than \u20b45.5 million. Another bidder, Strata22 LLC (now MKS LLC), offered a price half a million hryvnias lower and <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2024-10-25-011107-a\/complaints\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">complained<\/a> that the tender requirements had been deliberately tailored to fit Optomix, but its complaints went nowhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A month later, the department <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-11-29-011234-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">purchased<\/a> another 64 sets of training kits from Optomix for almost \u20b47.5 million \u2014 this time in a tender with no competition at all, where Optomix was the sole participant. And in May 2025, the firm received yet another contract, this time worth \u20b411.5 million, for <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2025-04-28-007988-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">supplying<\/a> mock Kalashnikov rifles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this last procurement that raised the most suspicion. Even though Optomix formally had a competitor, sole proprietor Serhiy Rymar, the Department of Education and Science still ended up buying the rifles at inflated prices: 91 Kalashnikov training models in 7.62 caliber and 59 in 5.45 caliber, each priced at \u20b464,165. The total paid was \u20b411,549,700 including VAT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"548\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks-1024x548.png\" alt=\"The Cost of Kalashnikov Rifle Training Models Sold by Optomix LLC to Ivano-Frankivsk Schools\n\" class=\"wp-image-1974\" title=\"The Cost of Kalashnikov Rifle Training Models Sold by Optomix LLC to Ivano-Frankivsk Schools\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks-1024x548.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks-1536x823.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835013_vartist_maketiv_avtomata_kalashnikova_tov_optomiks.png 1658w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Cost of Kalashnikov Rifle Training Models Sold by Optomix LLC to Ivano-Frankivsk Schools<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the market price of such training models <a href=\"https:\/\/filingun.com.ua\/ru\/maket-oruzhiya-wbp-jack-training-kal-762-mm\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">is<\/a> \u20b462,500 \u2014 for example, GrafikaProm LLC <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/contract\/UA-2025-06-23-010701-a-a2\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sold<\/a> the very same models in July 2025 to the Education Department of Krolevets City Council at that price.

He offered to sell the rifle mock-ups for \u20b411,745,200 \u2014 \u20b4195,000 more expensive. That automatically secured Optomix\u2019s win. But let\u2019s take a closer look at who Serhiy Rymar really is, the man who entered the tender with the least competitive price and never lowered it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to registry data, Rymar is a 76-year-old retiree from Kovel, Volyn region. He owns 11 land plots totaling more than 10 hectares and registered his FOP only on September 10, 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is more than likely that Rymar\u2019s FOP was nothing more than a fake competitor in the tender, a setup to hand the contract to Optomix. When we tried calling Rymar\u2019s personal phone, an unknown woman named Maryna picked up. She had no knowledge of the procurement and, when asked about rifle mock-ups, replied that no deliveries would be happening any time soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"advanced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" title=\"\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, behind the pensioner stands his 47-year-old son from Rivne, Andriy Rymar. Until May 14, 2024, Andriy was the founder, beneficiary, and director of TD RA LLC, a company with statutory capital of only \u20b4930. Today, that company has been re-registered under his wife, Tetiana Hnatiuk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2016 and 2025, TD RA LLC, registered at an <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/nRyQzYfXSWzZM4Ra8\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ordinary private house<\/a> in Kovel, 8 Berezovskoho Street, won state contracts worth about \u20b4178 million. Analysis shows that its main client has been Energoatom, particularly the Rivne NPP branch, along with the Khmelnytskyi and South Ukrainian NPPs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media <a href=\"https:\/\/nashigroshi.org\/2021\/03\/25\/dytiacha-likarnia-otrymala-16-propozytsiy-na-zakupivliu-zakhysnykh-kombinezoniv-tsina-znyzylasia-vdvichi\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> indicate TD RA LLC has regularly supplied goods to the state at inflated prices. In 2021, it sold overpriced protective suits to a children\u2019s hospital. In May 2023, Lvivteploenergo and Energoatom <a href=\"https:\/\/nashigroshi.org\/2023\/05\/27\/l-vivteploenerho-ta-enerhoatom-kupuiut-bih-behy-za-podviynoiu-tsinoiu\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">purchased<\/a> big bags from the company, in some cases at double the market price. In August 2023, the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/nashigroshi.org\/2023\/08\/21\/kharasho-sidim-top-10-krisel-z-derzhzakupivel-pid-chas-viyny\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sold<\/a> office chairs to the Khmelnytskyi NPP for \u20b414,382 each, for a total of \u20b43.06 million, even though the same chairs cost under \u20b410,000 on the manufacturer\u2019s website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tetiana Hnatiuk also profits from public tenders. Since opening her FOP in 2016, she has won contracts worth nearly \u20b424.4 million, mostly for supplying medical materials and equipment to hospitals. Meanwhile, the FOP registered under her father-in-law, Serhiy Rymar, in late 2024 managed in just nine months to take part in 938 tenders and win 48 contracts worth almost \u20b46.9 million. This is especially suspicious, as a 76-year-old retiree who had just entered business suddenly began winning tenders for everything imaginable \u2014 from furniture and kitchenware to medical equipment and cleaning products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This looks very much like a family operation, using a network of FOPs and LLCs to funnel budget money by staging fake competition in tenders and reselling goods to state institutions at inflated prices. Most likely, Rymar\u2019s FOP was simply used as a token rival to ensure Optomix\u2019s formal victory in the Ivano-Frankivsk Department of Education and Science tender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And considering that the Department bought an interactive laser shooting range from Optomix at a price \u20b4517,000 higher than another supplier\u2019s offer, we clearly see signs of budget losses averaging half a million hryvnias per procurement under the \u201cDefense of Ukraine\u201d program in schools and vocational colleges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, by the looks of it, Optomix was never a random company in this story. Beyond the Department of Education and Science, the Ivano-Frankivsk City Council\u2019s executive committee also quickly began contracting the firm. Just two months after its registration, officials started awarding Optomix one order after another for frontline supplies. Naturally, most of these were non-competitive, with Optomix as the only bidder, pointing to a pre-arranged agreement between the supplier and city officials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024\u20132025 alone, the executive committee handed Optomix 14 contracts for <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2024-06-26-007829-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">radar reflectors<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2024-06-26-008674-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">optical devices<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2024-07-09-002246-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">laptops<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-07-10-000758-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">mobile drone-detection systems<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-12-09-011045-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">tablets<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-12-09-011045-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">power banks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2025-06-05-013251-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">batteries<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2024-11-22-009868-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">quadcopters<\/a> \u2014 worth a total of \u20b43.02 million. Altogether, counting the Department of Education\u2019s tenders, Optomix has already received \u20b427.5 million from Ivano-Frankivsk officials in just one year of existence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it seems the Ivano-Frankivsk authorities, under the pretext of helping the military, simply found themselves a \u201cfriendly\u201d supplier to channel money through. Or perhaps, conversely, a local businessman offered officials the \u201cright terms\u201d to ensure the funds flowed through him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if3\"><strong>How Dmytro Shlimovych\u2019s Sole Proprietorship Inflates Prices for Army Supplies in Non-Competitive Tenders<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But the businessman in question is none other than Dmytro Shlimovych, founder and director of Optomix LLC. And, judging by the evidence, he is hardly a newcomer to siphoning budget funds in Ivano-Frankivsk. Beyond Optomix, Shlimovych has also operated as a <a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/edr\/3172402714\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sole proprietor (FOP)<\/a> since June 3, 2010. For years, this FOP occasionally won tenders to supply office equipment to officials. But with the start of the full-scale war, it abruptly \u201cpivoted\u201d to military supplies, and business took off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Prozorro shows dozens of purchases where the Ivano-Frankivsk City Council executive committee, without any competition, buys all sorts of items for the army from Shlimovych\u2019s FOP: DJI Mavic drones, kukri machetes, charging stations, polypropylene bags, even wristwatches. Whatever is ordered, Shlimovych delivers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The executive committee \u201cdiscovered\u201d Shlimovych\u2019s FOP in October 2023 and has been awarding him contract after contract ever since. To call them tenders would be misleading, since every single one had only one bidder. In practice, this meant prices were fixed \u2014 whatever Shlimovych quoted, the city paid. And unsurprisingly, he didn\u2019t sell charging stations, tablets, and drones cheaply. On the contrary, the prices were inflated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in October 2023, the executive committee bought two Motorola DM4600E vehicle radios from Shlimovych\u2019s FOP via a <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2023-10-26-012177-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">non-competitive tender<\/a> for \u20b479,998 \u2014 about \u20b440,000 apiece. The market price? Around \u20b430,000 each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or take DJI Mavic drones. In November 2023, the city <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2023-11-03-007732-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">bought<\/a> a DJI Mavic 3E from Shlimovych for \u20b4137,000. Had the tender been competitive, the price would likely have been much lower \u2014 the market average is <a href=\"https:\/\/storeinua.com\/products\/kvadrokopter-dji-mavic-3e-cpen0000041101\/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332821756&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAqKIxknnYtEq0NlU8jtcqqV6JDTXF&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwNbEBhBpEiwAFYLtGDXk43e44ArVXp5MQ51AURyF6QNFC3v1oisGvcsxPTyhPaDqaweX3hoCWwgQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">closer<\/a> to \u20b4100,000.

Between 2015 and 2025, his sole proprietorship secured contracts worth \u20b414.7 million. Before the war, his main product line consisted of computers, software, printers, and cartridge refills. But starting in 2023, Shlimovych shifted focus to supplying DJI Mavic drones, radios, and other goods for military needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, while already running his sole proprietorship, he founded a private company called \u201cBOB\u201d, which dealt in wholesale trade of computers, peripherals, and software. In 2024, the company was renamed Taurus Factum Line, where Shlimovych is now officially listed as the accountant. Between 2018 and 2024, this firm won government tenders worth \u20b450 million. Just like Shlimovych\u2019s sole proprietorship, before the war the company mainly supplied printers and cartridges, but today it delivers drones and spare parts for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/08\\\/cleaned1754834978_chlim-infographic_red.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1979&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:5513,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: How much and when Ivano-Frankivsk officials paid Dmytro Shlimovych for supplying goods for the military and for the \\u201cDefense of Ukraine\\u201d program in schools and vocational colleges.

That is why, for Shlimovych, it\u2019s no problem to register a new LLC and, just two months into its existence, start receiving one contract after another from these state institutions, which seem unfazed by the company\u2019s lack of experience, its tiny charter capital, and other red flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if5\"><strong>How Dmytro Shlimovych\u2019s Mother-in-Law, Vira Yaremko, Joined the Family Business of Selling Overpriced Drones to the Army<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is likely that the creation of Optomix LLC in 2024 and the renaming of BOB Private Enterprise to Taurus Factum Line had one main purpose \u2014 to divert unwanted attention from the name Shlimovych, which constantly appears in procurement contracts with Ivano-Frankivsk state institutions. This way, it looks as if the city council and the regional education department are spreading their budget spending across multiple suppliers, rather than channeling it all to the same person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably for the same reason, in 2024, on April 27, to be exact, Shlimovych\u2019s 67-year-old mother-in-law, Vira Yaremko, also registered as a private entrepreneur with the same primary activity: non-specialized wholesale trade. Just like Optomix, only four months after registration, Yaremko\u2019s business began receiving orders from the very same Ivano-Frankivsk City Council executive committee and the Department of Education and Science of the regional administration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August 2024, Shlimovych\u2019s mother-in-law signed contracts to supply the city council with three EcoFlow DELTA 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/tender\/UA-2024-08-08-007425-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">charging stations<\/a> for military use at a total of \u20b4144,000, and to supply the Department of Education with <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/uk\/contract\/UA-2024-07-31-007926-a-a1\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">equipment for media libraries<\/a> \u2014 five sets of computers, furniture, and accessories worth \u20b43,971,597. Both contracts, as usual, went through without competition \u2014 Vira Yaremko\u2019s company was the sole participant and therefore the automatic winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were the prices inflated in these deals? That\u2019s easy to check. In June 2024, the same Department of Education bought the same media library equipment from another private entrepreneur for \u20b48,243,653 for 11 sets or \u20b4749,423 per set. Yaremko\u2019s price came out to \u20b4794,319 per set, which is \u20b444,896 higher. That means the Department effectively overpaid Yaremko \u20b4224,500. Not a bad profit for a pensioner. Or rather, not for the pensioner herself, but for her overly enterprising son, Dmytro Shlimovych.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if6\"><strong>What Wealth Dmytro Shlimovych\u2019s Family Has Already Gained from Supplying the Armed Forces<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the fact that Dmytro Shlimovych\u2019s wife, 31-year-old Lidiya Shlimovych, worked as a civil servant at the Bankruptcy Department of the Western Interregional Office of the Ministry of Justice from 2016 to 2025, we were able to analyze her <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/8a22a997-4e73-4062-8a32-e927a25dbdf3\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">declarations<\/a> and the family\u2019s income. In 2022, Dmytro Shlimovych earned just $13,806 for the year. But in 2023, when he began supplying goods for the military through his private business, his annual income jumped to $70,200. And in 2024, after the creation of Optomix LLC, Shlimovych\u2019s income doubled again, reaching $140,000 for the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life for the family clearly improved. In June 2025, Dmytro\u2019s wife Lidiya became the owner of a 2023 Tesla Model Y <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_tesla_model_y_38546659.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> at least $31,000. Meanwhile, her mother, 76-year-old pensioner Vira Yaremko, bought herself a 2018 Audi Q5 in 2024, <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/car\/audi\/q5\/year\/2018\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">valued<\/a> at around $25,000 today. Not a bad haul, all thanks to inflated prices on goods supposedly meant for the front.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"325\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich-1024x325.png\" alt=\"Two expensive luxury cars parked on the street\" class=\"wp-image-1976\" title=\"Two expensive luxury cars parked on the street\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich-1024x325.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich-300x95.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich-768x244.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich-1536x488.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/cleaned1754835007_tesla_model_y_2023_audi_q5_2018_shlimovich.png 1970w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Cars Purchased by Dmytro Shlimovych\u2019s Wife and Mother-in-Law Over the Past Two Years of His Active Tender Wins in Ivano-Frankivsk<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if7\"><strong>Why State Watchdogs Don\u2019t Frighten Ivano-Frankivsk Officials<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few years, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine has repeatedly caught the Ivano-Frankivsk Department of Education and Science colluding with contractors during tenders. <a href=\"https:\/\/kurs.if.ua\/news\/povyazanni_firmy_rozigraly_tendery_na_ponad_20_mln_grn_na_postachannya_mebliv_dlya_prykarpatskyh_shkil_68263.html\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">For instance<\/a>, in 2018, firms linked to each other won over \u20b420 million in contracts to supply furniture for schools by imitating competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the same department, during a <a href=\"https:\/\/ngl.media\/2022\/12\/05\/osvityany-na-ivano-frankivshhyni-pereplatyat-majzhe-miljon-za-kulery-dlya-ukryttiv\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">tender<\/a> involving companies that clearly acted in collusion, planned to spend more than \u20b41 million on school shelter coolers at inflated prices, up to 70% higher than the market rate. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stopcor.org\/ukr\/section-suspilstvo\/news-udvichi-dorozhche-ivano-frankivschina-planue-pridbati-tehniku-dlya-shkil-za-zavischenimi-tsinami-u-figuranta-kriminalnih-sprav-13-07-2024.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">media reports<\/a>, in July 2024 the department was again caught trying to procure school computer equipment at prices twice the market value, from a company tied to a person under criminal investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dmytro Shlimovych himself has also attracted the attention of regulators. In 2019, the Antimonopoly Committee <a href=\"https:\/\/southwestmtv.amcu.gov.ua\/news\/tekhnichniy-uchasnik-podav-tendernu-propozitsiyu-prikrittya\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">exposed<\/a> a collusion involving Shlimovych\u2019s sole proprietorship and that of Tetiana Vaskova. They coordinated their actions in a tender for multifunctional devices worth \u20b4205,040, announced by the Khmelnytskyi City Council. Shlimovych acted as a \u201ctechnical\u201d participant, deliberately submitting a non-compliant bid to secure the win for his partner. Both entrepreneurs shared the same address and phone number and submitted documents referencing equipment owned by Shlimovych. For these actions, the Antimonopoly Committee fined both \u20b432,000 and banned them from public procurement for three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is clear that the tenders organized by the Ivano-Frankivsk Department of Education and Science under the \u201cDefense of Ukraine\u201d program, aimed at preparing children for wartime, show the same signs of collusion with Shlimovych and his company Optomix. The head of the department, Viktor Kimakovych, has held this position since 2015. And judging by the facts, neither the Antimonopoly Committee nor law enforcement agencies pose any threat to him. The same applies to members of the Ivano-Frankivsk City Executive Committee, who freely exploit the Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 resolution allowing simplified, non-competitive wartime procurement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is just one of many cases showing how, in the middle of war, officials in the rear misuse funds for military aid and national defense programs by colluding with shady businessmen in sham tenders, pocketing profits from the state budget. It seems that national oversight of procurement has turned a blind eye to these local deals, even though they involve hundreds of millions of hryvnias. One need only recall the story of <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/kseniya-sushko-zastupnyczya-mera-dnipra-borysa-filatova-unykaye-tyurmy-vidmyvayuchy-miljony-na-remontah-shkil\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">Dnipro Deputy Mayor Kseniia Sushko<\/a>, mired in school repair tender scandals yet never held accountable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. Interestingly, 48-year-old Dmytro Shlimovych, officially registered in Ivano-Frankivsk in 2025, lists Haifa, Israel, as his residence on his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dshlimovich\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page<\/a>. If true, it makes the story even more outrageous: looting Ukraine\u2019s defense budget for profit while living abroad is the height of audacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large

This isn\u2019t a story about smart saving or living modestly on a small salary.

Media reports <a href=\"https:\/\/vidomo.media\/ukr\/dossier\/nesterenko-kirill-oleksandrovich\" rel=\"nofollow\">linked<\/a> Nesterenko to Kolomoiskyi as well, suggesting that he entered the &#171;Sluha Narodu&#187; party as part of the so-called &#171;Kolomoiskyi group.&#187; In 2019, Nesterenko <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/yak-sluga-narodu-kyrylo-nesterenko-na-shemah-iz-neruhomistyu-zarobyv-na-zakordonni-vidpustky-pid-chas-vijny\/\">ran for parliament<\/a> in single-mandate constituency No. 26 in Dnipropetrovsk region.

On August 22, 2023, Nesterenko was stopped by police at 11:50 pm while driving this car under the influence of alcohol.

He actively promoted the idea of tax amnesty. Alongside Sviatoslav Oliinyk, Nesterenko became involved in scandals concerning <a href=\"https:\/\/dnepr.express\/ru\/post\/zaimis-okrugom-a-ne-vozi-ekskursii-v-kharkov-v-dnepre-gorozhane-ni-razu-ne-videli-na-okruge-ze-deputata-nesterenko-foto\" rel=\"nofollow\">poor-quality road repairs<\/a> in Dnipro and the <a href=\"https:\/\/patrioty.org.ua\/politic\/kupyly-dlia-neisnuiuchoi-sportyvnoi-shkoly-iak-dnipropetrovska-oblrada-pylyt-milion-na-volanchykakh--rozsliduvannia-331957.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">purchase<\/a> of badminton shuttlecocks by the Dnipro Regional Council for a non-existent sports school. Since russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Nesterenko has largely disappeared from public view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nes2\"><strong>Where MP Kyrylo Nesterenko Spends His Vacations During the War<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the three years of the war, Nesterenko spent a lot of time traveling abroad for vacations. Because of this, he rarely had time for his parliamentary duties. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, the MP traveled abroad 14 times during this period, mostly for leisure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2022, he visited Spain. In June 2022, he went to Monaco and Nice in France. He visited Budapest in July 2022, and in August 2022, he traveled to Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. During that trip, he visited the BMW Museum in Munich and the Montserrat Monastery in Barcelona.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September and October 2022, Nesterenko returned to Budapest. In November, he traveled to Poland, and in December, he visited Slovakia and Hungary again. In June 2023, Nesterenko traveled to the Netherlands, and in December 2023, he visited Estonia and Austria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 16, 2025, Nesterenko bought ski equipment from the EXTREMSTYLE store. On January 21, he left for Warsaw via Lviv, likely going further to a ski resort for another vacation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when in Kyiv, the young MP prefers expensive leisure activities instead of staying home. He frequently visits the luxurious Fairmont hotel, spending between 17,000 and 22,000 hryvnias per visit. He also often dines at the expensive restaurant Gosti, where a dinner costs around 12,000 hryvnias. According to our information, he enjoys visiting other high-end Kyiv restaurants such as Bassano, Virgin Izakaya, Under Wonder, and Catch. Additionally, he often relaxes at the luxury countryside resorts Verholy Relax Park and Shelest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nes3\"><strong>How Much Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s Expenses Exceed His Official Income<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, a monthly salary of 55,000 hryvnias isn&#8217;t enough for such an expensive lifestyle. And besides this salary, Kyrylo Nesterenko has no other official income. According to Nesterenko&#8217;s declarations, in 2022 he <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/331bd400-dfec-4258-a78c-012c27362c85\" rel=\"nofollow\">earned<\/a> a total of 426,737 hryvnias \u2014 approximately 35,500 hryvnias per month. In 2023, his MP salary <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/7ad2f487-c5f0-4939-bea7-0d88a1806589\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased<\/a> to 664,576 hryvnias for the year. He also earned an additional 510,000 hryvnias from selling a 2009 Volkswagen Multivan, which he originally bought in January 2021 for just 194,932 hryvnias. This itself is interesting: the car somehow increased in value by 2.5 times in just two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if we accept this, Nesterenko\u2019s total official income in 2023 was 1,174,576 hryvnias. But here&#8217;s another curious detail: according to his 2023 declaration, he managed to save roughly two-thirds of that income. His savings grew from $10,000 in 2022 to $22,000 in 2023, from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac10,000, and from 56,000 hryvnias to 150,000 hryvnias in cash and bank accounts. Altogether, that&#8217;s about 789,000 hryvnias. It means that somehow Nesterenko managed to live the entire year on just 385,000 hryvnias, or about 32,000 hryvnias per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seen similar suspicious savings with another MP from the &#171;European Solidarity&#187; party, Viktoria Siumar, who also somehow managed not only to live comfortably on a single MP\u2019s salary but also build mansions and <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/ru\/kak-viktoriya-syumar-na-odnu-zarplatu-nardepa-stroit-pomestya-i-pokupaet-kvartiry\/\">put aside millions<\/a> of hryvnias.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering that Nesterenko spends between 12,000 and 22,000 hryvnias for just one evening at a restaurant and regularly travels abroad, it&#8217;s hard to believe he genuinely lives on 32,000 hryvnias per month. In reality, he&#8217;s clearly living on different, unofficial income. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Nesterenko\u2019s documented expenses alone over the past three years amounted to 4.6 million hryvnias \u2014 twice his official income. This should attract attention from authorities, including Ukraine\u2019s State Financial Monitoring Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to his MP salary, Kyrylo Nesterenko receives state compensation for renting an apartment in Kyiv and for expenses related to his parliamentary duties. He also regularly gets financial support from his brother, Yehor Nesterenko. Moreover, the MP sometimes spends amounts equal to twice his monthly salary, using money from unknown sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the funds Nesterenko gets from the state \u2014 around 20,000 hryvnias per month \u2014 for renting accommodation in Kyiv have never actually been used for this purpose. He pays for renting an apartment in Kyiv with completely different money. Moreover, the apartment he rents is far from modest: it covers 106 square meters in the elite Pecherskyi district of Kyiv, at 17 Panasa Myrnoho Street. The monthly rent there clearly exceeds 20,000 hryvnias.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, this apartment is owned by a former judge of the Odesa District Administrative Court. He was dismissed amid scandal after being declared <a href=\"https:\/\/vkksu.gov.ua\/doc\/pro-rezultaty-kvalifikaciynogo-ocinyuvannya-suddi-odeskogo-okruzhnogo-administratyvnogo-sudu-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">unfit<\/a> for his position due to false declarations and inability to explain how he funded numerous foreign trips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the current tenant of his apartment \u2014 Kyrylo Nesterenko, the MP from the \u201cSluha Narodu\u201d party \u2014 also uses money from unclear sources. His spending regularly exceeds his official income by several times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nes4\"><strong>Where Does MP Nesterenko Get The Money for His Luxurious Lifestyle?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This naturally leads to the question: where does this money come from? Could it be from Kyrylo Nesterenko&#8217;s parents?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrylo\u2019s father, Oleksandr Nesterenko, spent his entire career in banking. He began working at the Sumy department of the National Bank of Ukraine in 1993. Since 1997, he&#8217;s been employed by UkrSibbank, currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexander-nesterenko-33962813\/?originalSubdomain=ua\" rel=\"nofollow\">serving<\/a> as head of the IT Infrastructure Support Center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrylo\u2019s mother, Inha Nesterenko, has owned the Yard Space coworking and caf\u00e9 since November 2019. It\u2019s located in the village of Sofiivska Borshchahivka, at 30\/2 Heroiv Nebesnoi Sotni Avenue, within the residential complex Lvivskyi Maetok. However, based on its Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yard.space\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">page<\/a>, this business wasn&#8217;t particularly successful \u2014 it\u2019s currently closed, and Inha Nesterenko is advertising the space for rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897115_kovorking_yard_space_jk_lvivskiy_zatyshok.png\" alt=\"A caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of a newly built six-story building\n\" class=\"wp-image-1522\" style=\"width:566px;height:auto\" title=\"A caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of a newly built six-story building\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897115_kovorking_yard_space_jk_lvivskiy_zatyshok.png 970w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897115_kovorking_yard_space_jk_lvivskiy_zatyshok-291x300.png 291w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897115_kovorking_yard_space_jk_lvivskiy_zatyshok-768x792.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Coworking space Yard Space, owned by MP Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s mother, Inha Nesterenko, in the Lvivskyi Maetok residential complex in Sofiivska Borshchahivka.

Yehor is a student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. Between 2020 and 2023, he headed a marketing group at Konica Minolta Ukraine. Currently, he operates as a self-employed consultant in commercial business matters. Yehor also managed his mother\u2019s coworking space. According to how his phone number is listed in the GetContact app (e.g., &#171;Yehor Our Building Apartment Complex,&#187; &#171;Apartment Family Yehor,&#187; and &#171;Yehor Nesterenko Lvivskyi Maetok&#187;), it appears he, like his mother, works in real estate connected to the Lvivskyi Maetok complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that an ordinary bank employee or realtor could finance not only their own lives but also the lavish lifestyle of their son, who is a member of parliament. Interestingly, a clue regarding the source of Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s unexplained wealth leads directly to the Lvivskyi Maetok residential complex. This is the same complex where his mother works (or previously worked) in sales, owns coworking premises, and which is associated with his brother\u2019s real estate activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nes5\"><strong>How MP Nesterenko\u2019s Father and Brother Spent Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars on Real Estate near Kyiv<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrylo Nesterenko himself does not officially own any real estate, nor does his mother. However, an interesting situation arises regarding his father. According to Ukrainian registries, Kyrylo&#8217;s father, Oleksandr Nesterenko, acquired two apartments through assignment agreements from the developer, LLC &#171;Lvivskyi Maetok,&#187; located in the village of Sofiivska Borshchahivka near Kyiv.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first apartment (#128, with an area of 60.9 sq. meters) was purchased on August 10, 2021, for 1,254,540 hryvnias. The second apartment (#128, with an area of 60.9 sq. meters) was also purchased in August 2021, at a price of 1,254,540 hryvnias. He later sold the first apartment on December 1, 2023, for 3,223,200 hryvnias.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, within two years, Oleksandr Nesterenko bought two apartments for around 2.5 million hryvnias from the developer and later sold them for nearly 6.3 million hryvnias \u2014 earning more than double what he initially paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/02\\\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1523&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:690px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1268,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:722,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: apartment sale and purchase agreement in Ukraine&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;apartment sale and purchase agreement in Ukraine&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov-1024x583.png\" alt=\"apartment sale and purchase agreement in Ukraine\" class=\"wp-image-1523\" style=\"width:690px;height:auto\" title=\"apartment sale and purchase agreement in Ukraine\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov-1024x583.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov-768x437.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897091_dogovir_kupivli_prodaju_nesterenko_korzhov.png 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: apartment sale and purchase agreement in Ukraine\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s father, Oleksandr Nesterenko, also purchased another apartment in the same residential complex, &#171;Lvivskyi Zatyshok,&#187; at 1 Vidpochynku Street, apartment 84, in Sofiivska Borshchahivka. The 41.2-square-meter apartment was bought on August 27, 2024, for 1,353,000 UAH. A month later, he acquired a small non-residential space (4.2 square meters) there for 83,160 UAH. Both properties have not yet been sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Oleksandr Nesterenko bought another commercial property (#148) measuring 65.3 square meters at 36 Heroiv Nebesnoi Sotni Avenue in Sofiivska Borshchahivka. He purchased this space from Hanna Dubchak for 326,300 UAH and later sold it in 2023 for 550,000 UAH. Additionally, Nesterenko bought two parking spaces (11 and 20 sq.m.) in the same building from Dubchak on December 6, 2021, for 89,000 UAH and 152,900 UAH, respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not all. On December 22, 2022, Oleksandr Nesterenko bought four commercial spaces in the building at 30\/1 Heroiv Nebesnoi Sotni Avenue in Sofiivska Borshchahivka from Viktor Myalyk. Later, in June 2023, he purchased an 18.1-square-meter garage for 130,000 UAH in the neighboring building (#34).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, on March 1, 2024, he bought another nine small commercial spaces from the same Viktor Myalyk at 30 Heroiv Nebesnoi Sotni Avenue. These premises range from 1.2 to 7.2 square meters, each costing between 13,000 and 30,000 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past four years, Oleksandr Nesterenko, an employee of UkrSibbank, bought apartments and commercial spaces in residential complexes in Sofiivska Borshchahivka for a total of approximately $162,000. Some of these properties he has already resold at double their purchase price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s brother, Yehor, has also been actively buying properties, notably from the same sellers. In 2019, Yehor purchased a 72.1-square-meter apartment in the &#171;Lvivskyi Maetok&#187; residential complex at 30\/2 Heroiv Nebesnoi Sotni Avenue from Viktor Myalyk for just 300,000 UAH. In the neighboring building (#30\/1), Yehor bought a small commercial space (1.8 sq. m.) for 16,242 UAH. In another building (#28\/2), he bought another commercial property (76.7 sq. m.) for 421,600 UAH, reselling it just seven months later for 674,960 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2022, Yehor purchased two parking spaces (each 13.7 sq. m.) from Viktor Myalyk \u2014 one for 48,000 UAH and the other for 58,000 UAH. Additionally, in September 2023, he bought another commercial property measuring 48.6 sq. m. from Myalyk for 184,600 UAH. Yehor continued buying properties from Myalyk in 2024, purchasing four small commercial spaces totaling 7.4 sq. m. for 46,800 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another commercial space of 64.7 sq. m. was bought by Yehor Nesterenko from Valeriy Omelianenko in October 2010 for 388,976 UAH. Lastly, Yehor also purchased apartment #168 directly from the developer, &#171;MDS-Bud,&#187; located at 103\/20 Soborna Street in Sofiivska Borshchahivka for 906,240 UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"917\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897099_dovidka_yehor_nesterenko_kupivlya_kvartyry_jk_lvivskiy_mayetok-917x1024.png\" alt=\"Receipt confirming Yehor Nesterenko's payment of 906,240 UAH for property rights to Apartment No. 168 (76.2 square meters) in the building at 103\/20 Soborna Street, Sofiivska Borshchahivka\" class=\"wp-image-1524\" style=\"width:567px;height:auto\" title=\"Receipt confirming Yehor Nesterenko's payment of 906,240 UAH for property rights to Apartment No. 168 (76.2 square meters) in the building at 103\/20 Soborna Street, Sofiivska Borshchahivka\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897099_dovidka_yehor_nesterenko_kupivlya_kvartyry_jk_lvivskiy_mayetok-917x1024.png 917w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897099_dovidka_yehor_nesterenko_kupivlya_kvartyry_jk_lvivskiy_mayetok-269x300.png 269w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897099_dovidka_yehor_nesterenko_kupivlya_kvartyry_jk_lvivskiy_mayetok-768x857.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897099_dovidka_yehor_nesterenko_kupivlya_kvartyry_jk_lvivskiy_mayetok.png 962w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Receipt confirming Yehor Nesterenko&#8217;s payment of 906,240 UAH for property rights to Apartment No. 168 (76.2 square meters) in the building at 103\/20 Soborna Street, Sofiivska Borshchahivka<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, Yehor Nesterenko has spent around $84,000 on properties over the last five years. Isn&#8217;t this interesting? After Kyrylo Nesterenko was elected to parliament, his father and younger brother suddenly began actively buying apartments, commercial spaces, parking spots, and garages in several new residential complexes in Sofiivska Borshchahivka, near Kyiv. They spent more than $200,000 on these purchases, even though Oleksandr Nesterenko is a regular bank employee and Yehor Nesterenko is a student who works as a realtor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nes6\"><strong>How Kyrylo Nesterenko&#8217;s Family Helps MP Viktor Myalyk Evade Taxes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most interesting part isn&#8217;t even this. What&#8217;s truly intriguing is who exactly sold all this real estate to the MP\u2019s close relatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the analytical system YouControl, MDS-Bud LLC, registered in 2013, is responsible for building the residential complex &#171;Lvivskyi Zatyshok&#187; (formerly known as &#171;Lvivskyi Maetok&#187;). The founder, beneficiary, and director of this company \u2014 with a registered capital of just 9,000 UAH \u2014 is Hanna Dubchak. She&#8217;s the same person who sold commercial property and two parking spaces in this complex to Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another seller, Viktor Myalyk, is himself the <a href=\"https:\/\/itd.rada.gov.ua\/mps\/info\/page\/21252\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP<\/a> of Ukraine from the parliamentary group &#171;Za Maibutnie,&#187; associated with oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Before becoming the MP, Myalyk was also the founder and financial director of MDS-Bud. His assistant, Roman Yankovskyi, served as a founder and director of the same company from July 2016 until November 2020. Meanwhile, Valeriy Omelianenko works as a technical supervision engineer at MDS-Bud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s another curious detail: in September 2021, Viktor Myalyk was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pravda.com.ua\/rus\/news\/2021\/09\/24\/7308304\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">charged<\/a> with tax evasion totaling over 118 million UAH. The charges related to real estate sales in newly built complexes in Sofiivska and Petropavlivska Borshchahivka. According to investigators, from 2012 to 2019, Myalyk sold apartments and commercial properties constructed by his own company as his personal property. He did this without registering as a private entrepreneur or legal entity, thus paying only 5% in taxes instead of the required 18%. Yet, as often happens in Ukraine \u2014 especially involving Kyiv\u2019s Pechersk District Court \u2014 Myalyk was <a href=\"https:\/\/nv.ua\/ukr\/ukraine\/politics\/viktor-myalik-sud-vipravdav-nardepa-yakiy-volodiye-ponad-150-kvartirami-pid-kiyevom-50379211.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquitted<\/a> in December 2023 and avoided any responsibility for this massive <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/who-profits-during-the-war-how-ukrainians-avoid-taxes-and-buy-luxury-cars-worth-tens-of-millions-of-hryvnias\/\">tax evasion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2020, Myalyk <a href=\"https:\/\/nv.ua\/ukr\/ukraine\/politics\/hto-z-deputativ-volodiye-naybilshoyu-kilkistyu-kvartir-infografika-novini-ukrajini-50095019.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">owned<\/a> 158 apartments with a total area of 11,530 square meters. Overall, he possessed 1,300 real estate properties, including commercial spaces, parking spots, and land plots. However, after he was charged with tax evasion, his 2022 financial declaration <a href=\"https:\/\/nv.ua\/ukraine\/politics\/deklaracii-nardepov-za-2022-god-u-kogo-iz-politikov-bolshe-vsego-kvartir-50394319.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">listed<\/a> only about 300 properties, including just 33 apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, some of the properties that &#171;disappeared&#187; from Myalyk\u2019s ownership ended up in the hands of&nbsp; Kyrylo Nesterenko\u2019s father and brother \u2014 Nesterenko being Myalyk\u2019s parliamentary colleague. Essentially, Myalyk used Nesterenko\u2019s family members to conceal his assets while under criminal investigation. He effectively transferred to them his illegal real estate business, allowing them to resell properties previously bought from Myalyk, Dubchak, and directly from MDS-Bud LLC at prices twice as high as the original purchase price. They also sold these properties without registering as private entrepreneurs or legal entities, thus evading an additional 13% in taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/02\\\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1525&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:5484,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: How much real estate in \\u0022Lvivskyi Zatyshok\\u0022 was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;How much real estate in \\u0022Lvivskyi Zatyshok\\u0022 was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"987\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-1024x987.png\" alt=\"How much real estate in &quot;Lvivskyi Zatyshok&quot; was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko\" class=\"wp-image-1525\" title=\"How much real estate in &quot;Lvivskyi Zatyshok&quot; was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-1024x987.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-300x289.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-768x740.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-1536x1480.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/cleaned1739897153_red-nesterenko-infographic-2048x1973.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: How much real estate in &quot;Lvivskyi Zatyshok&quot; was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>How much real estate in &#171;Lvivskyi Zatyshok&#187; was resold by MP Viktor Mialyk and his associates to the family of MP Kyrylo Nesterenko.

Even fewer can buy property during wartime, especially in new high-end buildings. And almost no one can afford a place in Kyiv\u2019s most luxurious complex \u2014 Taryan Towers. But 33-year-old Ruslan Averin from Zhovti Vody, Dnipropetrovsk region, can afford all of the above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ruslan.av.18\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page<\/a>, Averin now lives in Singapore. During the war, he\u2019s been traveling the world and occasionally returning to Ukraine \u2014 to buy apartments in some of the country\u2019s most expensive buildings. Over the past three years, he purchased 12 properties in Kyiv.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes four apartments in the UNIT.Home complex, worth at least $436,000; three more in the Faina-Town residential area, worth no less than $439,000; and another one \u2014 85 square meters \u2014 in the premium-class Jack House on Lesi Ukrainky Boulevard, worth <a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/flats-sale\/view\/11800089\/?utm_term=2709421747&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_campaign=external_rank_149\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">around<\/a> $399,000. All of these were bought recently \u2014 in 2024 and 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also purchased three apartments in Taryan Towers, on Ioanna Pavla II Street 12. The first one \u2014 unit No. 19, 62.6 square meters \u2014 was bought in June 2023. The second \u2014 No. 375, 61.6 square meters \u2014 in August 2024. And the third, the largest \u2014 No. 249, 91.2 square meters \u2014 was purchased in September 2024. These three alone cost him at least $1.14 million. In total, Averin has spent close to $2.5 million on real estate in Kyiv during wartime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also found the money to buy two brand-new cars \u2014 a Lexus LX 500D and a 2023 Hyundai Venue \u2014 worth $120,000 and $22,000 respectively. <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/komu-pry-vijni-zhyty-dobre-yak-ukrayinczi-ne-splachuyut-podatky-ta-kupuyut-sobi-avto-za-desyatky-miljoniv-gryven\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">Huge sums<\/a> that raise serious questions about their origin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ukrainian records, Averin has no ownership in any business. Only since November 29, 2024, he has been registered as a sole proprietor, officially renting out real estate. But this status has a yearly <a href=\"https:\/\/diia.gov.ua\/tax-systems\/3-grupa\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">income limit<\/a> of around 9.3 million UAH \u2014 about $227,000. Even if he immediately hit the maximum income, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to buy even one apartment in Taryan Towers \u2014 especially since he bought all three before he even opened the sole proprietorship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Averin is not a public figure. There is no information about him online, and his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ruslan_averinq?igsh=bTdleHB6ODRmaWF0\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">social media<\/a> accounts are private. It\u2019s unclear who he is or where his money comes from. None of his relatives appear to run any major business that could generate millions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His mother, Tetiana Averina, worked as an assembler at the Southern Radio Plant in Zhovti Vody. His father, Viktor Averin, was a mechanic there and later worked as a driver. His sister, Marharyta Averina, seems to live a typical family life with two kids and organizes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@m.a.r.g.o.s.h.a.17.06\/video\/7325362723708030213\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">volunteer fundraising<\/a> for Ukraine\u2019s military.

Based on her phone listing in GetContact, she previously worked for the tax service. She has no visible business, at least not a legal one. Her father, Volodymyr Voronin, is retired. Her mother, Svitlana Voronina, once owned a small 3.39% share in a now-defunct company called Promelektromontazh, which has been in the process of liquidation since 2008. In 2020, Svitlana was employed as a teacher at a school in Zhovti Vody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daria\u2019s brother, Pavlo Voronin, is the only other family member besides Averin who owns a registered business. He\u2019s been a sole proprietor since July 2017, working in software development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, like Averin, Pavlo also began buying expensive real estate after the start of the full-scale invasion. In May 2023, he purchased a 5.4 square meter commercial unit in the Nyvky-Park complex for <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-spetsialnoe-pomeschenie-kiev-shevchenkovskiy-beresteyskiy-pobedy-prospekt-32700538.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">$6,500<\/a>. Back in 2020, he bought an 85.4 square meter apartment in the same complex for about <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-kvartira-kiev-svyatoshinskiy-beresteyskiy-pobedy-prospekt-32971393.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">$180,000<\/a>. In June 2024, he purchased a four-room, 122.6 square meter apartment in the Faina Town complex \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/flats-sale\/view\/11694189\/?utm_term=2350279922&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_campaign=external_rank_198\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> at least $335,000 without renovation. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">our calculations<\/a>, Pavlo Voronin now owns property worth over 23.4 million UAH \u2014 about $560,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, under Ukrainian law, sole proprietors in his category can only legally earn up to 9.3 million UAH a year. So where did Pavlo get the money to buy such expensive property in 2024? He has no other known business assets or ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/05\\\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1734&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:4709,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: Infographic showing real estate and vehicles owned by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin from Zhovti Vody\\n&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Infographic showing real estate and vehicles owned by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin from Zhovti Vody\\n&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"847\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-1024x847.png\" alt=\"Infographic showing real estate and vehicles owned by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin from Zhovti Vody\n\" class=\"wp-image-1734\" title=\"Infographic showing real estate and vehicles owned by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin from Zhovti Vody\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-1024x847.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-300x248.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-768x635.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-1536x1271.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/186215601-114912226-aver_voron-2048x1694.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: Infographic showing real estate and vehicles owned by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin from Zhovti Vody\n\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Properties and cars acquired by Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin during the full-scale war<br>Infographic by BlackBox OSINT<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So what exactly are Ruslan Averin and Pavlo Voronin \u2014 both from Zhovti Vody \u2014 doing for a living? There is no online trace of their work or earnings. Yet they are spending millions on the country\u2019s most expensive real estate during wartime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, it\u2019s safe to assume the money is not legal. And whether it\u2019s coming from <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/a-fraudster-with-a-diplomatic-passport-how-romanias-honorary-consul-in-kharkiv-mykola-udianskyi-made-a-fortune-on-crypto-scams-part-1\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">crypto schemes<\/a>, call-center fraud, or something else \u2014 that\u2019s a question for law enforcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tr2\"><strong>Apartment No. 384: How Market trader Nataliia Kucher Ended Up With a Half-Million-Dollar Apartment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2024, a 50-year-old woman from Dnipro Nataliia Kucher became the owner of apartment No. 384 in Taryan Towers \u2014 a 90.8 square meter unit in one of the country\u2019s most expensive residential complexes. This was her first ever property. She had never owned a home or a car before. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/flats-sale\/view\/11628926\/?utm_term=2098944975&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_campaign=external_rank_400\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">price<\/a> of this apartment, fully renovated, is at least $520,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 1999 to 2016, Nataliia Kucher was registered as a sole proprietor, selling clothes, shoes, and textiles at street markets. So the question of where she got half a million dollars is, to say the least, very intriguing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, her son from her first marriage, Artur Kucher, is also registered in Dnipro. He has no ownership in any business, just a sole proprietorship since September 5, 2023 \u2014 for renting out property, even though he doesn\u2019t actually own any real estate. The only thing in his name is a 2017 Ford Mustang, <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_ford_mustang_36343892.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> around $23,000. And yet, on his private <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kucher_art\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram<\/a> bio, it says: \u201c\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 Master of life. I take the most out of life. I\u2019ve got carte blanche \ud83e\udd19\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kucher\u2019s current husband, Serhii Sekretariov, also doesn\u2019t own any property, cars, or stakes in business. From 2008 until February 2025, he had a sole proprietorship for \u201cother finishing construction works.\u201d But after all those years, he still didn\u2019t manage to buy himself a home or a car. Hard to believe he\u2019s the one who handed over $500,000 for the apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also worth noting \u2014 Serhii has a criminal past. In the 1990s, he was repeatedly convicted. As of 2015, he had two administrative charges for domestic violence, profanity, and threats of physical harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"243\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya-1024x243.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from the Unified State Register of Court Decisions with cases from the Leninskyi District Court of Dnipro\n\" class=\"wp-image-1736\" title=\"Screenshot from the Unified State Register of Court Decisions with cases from the Leninskyi District Court of Dnipro\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya-1024x243.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya-300x71.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya-768x182.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya-1536x364.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/897728163-272336336-serhii_sekretariov_sudovi_rishennya.png 1672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Court cases involving Serhii Sekretariov<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their son, 32-year-old Denys Sekretariov, also has no business ownership.

His social media also doesn\u2019t reflect a luxury lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no signs of wealth among Kucher\u2019s other relatives either. Her father, Volodymyr Syzonenko, used to work in construction and the building materials industry. No business, no sole proprietorship. Her mother, Valentyna Syzonenko, was a preschool teacher and later a facility manager. For a time, she ran a market stall selling shoes \u2014 registered as a sole proprietor from 2017 to January 2025. But let\u2019s be honest: selling boots at a market doesn\u2019t bring in millions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nataliia\u2019s brother, Oleksandr Syzonenko, has no known source of income either. No business, no sole proprietorship. Based on the GetContact app, his phone is saved as \u201csecurity guard\u201d.

The total value of her purchase amounts to 27.3 million UAH (around $654,000).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of her new neighbors in Taryan Towers, Oksana Berezhna has no visible source of income or business that could explain such spending. Her only brief entrepreneurial activity was a private business she operated in the legal services sector from 2012 to 2013. Since then, there has been no record of official employment or income. Yet, over the past two years, in addition to buying property in Taryan Towers, she also acquired three cars: a 2011 Citroen Berlingo worth $8,300, a 2007 Citroen C3 worth $4,500 and a luxury 2013 Land Rover Range Rover <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_land_rover_range_rover_37412781.htmlhttps:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_land_rover_range_rover_37412781.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> about $52,500. Altogether, her assets are worth at least 30 million UAH (around $719,300).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can a woman from an occupied town with no business or employment afford such purchases during a full-scale war? Her profile in the Getcontact app raises further questions: tags like \u201cOksana Yalta Donetsk\u201d, \u201cBti Ksyusha\u201d, and \u201cOksana Makiivka\u201d give no indication of ties to the business elite. She is virtually inactive on messaging platforms like Viber and Telegram, and only maintains a Facebook profile, painting a picture of someone who avoids attention. To understand where the money came from, it\u2019s worth looking at her family \u2014 particularly her brother, Serhii Berezhnyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 2014, Serhii Berezhnyi likely moved from Makiivka to Zaporizhzhia, where he registered several entities: Novaia Medytsyna LLC, Metaklinika LLC, Oktamed-Zaporizhzhia LLC, and the NGO Donbas Health. Since July 2024, he has also been registered as a sole proprietor offering market research services. However, the financial health of his companies is questionable. Metaklinika LLC, which employs just two people, reported a profit of only 4,700 UAH in 2022. Oktamed-Zaporizhzhia LLC has not submitted any financial reports since 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"238\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_-1024x238.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1745\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_-1024x238.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_-300x70.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_-768x179.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_-1536x357.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/372614146-950990320-tov_metaklinika_finansova_zvitnist_.png 1540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Metaclinic, owned by Serhii Berezhnyi, has shown no activity since 2023.

On September 27, 2021, Yevhen Chernohubov, an entrepreneur from Kharkiv, purchased apartment No. 371 in Taryan Towers \u2014 90.8 square meters in size and worth $520,000. But on February 15, 2025, he transferred it as a contribution to the statutory capital of the newly founded company Fortis Group Capital LLC, registered just three days prior. The transaction was carried out through a representative in Portugal: acting on Chernohubov\u2019s behalf was Said Javid, authorized via a power of attorney issued in Lisbon \u2014 suggesting that Chernohubov currently resides there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would someone transfer such a luxurious apartment to a company with a statutory capital of only 127,000 UAH and a director and beneficiary \u2014 Imrani Jila Sayed Jahanzyb \u2014 about whom nothing is known publicly? The answer seems to lie in Chernohubov\u2019s business empire, built on dubious schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chernohubov is the founder and beneficiary of several Kharkiv-based companies, including International Financial Operator Lider LLC, Lidomed Bio Incorporated LLC, and Scientific Production Enterprise Lidomed-Bio LLC, the latter co-owned with his father. Notably, all these companies are currently operating at a loss. For example, Lider ended 2022 with a loss of 329,000 UAH; Lidomed Bio Incorporated posted a 2.6 million UAH loss in 2024; and Lidomed-Bio lost 339,000 UAH. None of these companies appear capable of generating half a million dollars to fund a Taryan Towers apartment. So, where did the money come from?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to Chernohubov\u2019s wealth seems to lie in his highly questionable projects. Lidomed-Bio promotes the \u201cLidomed-Bio\u201d device \u2014 a pseudomedical gadget that claims to offer \u201ccomprehensive diagnostics,\u201d antiparasitic and antifungal effects, and even cures everything of asthma to hepatitis C. The device is sold not only in Ukraine but also in russia \u2014 which raises even more questions during wartime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another of his ventures, WebWellness, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/292603817920220\/posts\/681147359065862\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">promises<\/a> clients \u201cthe perfect body and health\u201d, and even immunity to COVID-19 or relief from allergies \u2014 all for a hefty fee of 500\u2013600 euros.

And it wasn\u2019t the only one. Assets worth another $259,000 are registered in the name of his wife, Yulia Chernohubova. Between 2020 and 2021, she became the owner of a 0.2166-hectare land plot in Kharkiv, eight small apartments in the same building on 11 Bestuzheva Street (each measuring 18.4 square meters and <a href=\"https:\/\/dom.ria.com\/uk\/realty-prodaja-kvartira-harkov-saltovka-kovalevskaya-bestujeva-ulitsa-32994193.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> a total of $128,000), as well as a 105.6-square-meter apartment on Moskovskyi Avenue 131-B and a 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE 350 <a href=\"https:\/\/auto.ria.com\/uk\/auto_mercedes_benz_gle_class_38127392.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">worth<\/a> $51,000. Yulia Chernohubova does not own any business or corporate rights, so it is safe to say that the money for all this property came from her husband\u2019s activities \u2014 which are both illegal and morally and legally dubious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combined value of the Chernohubovs\u2019 assets reaches 32.5 million UAH or about $779,000, which is entirely disproportionate to the financial performance of Chernohubov\u2019s companies. The transfer of the Taryan Towers apartment to Fortis Group Capital via a proxy was likely no coincidence. This scheme allows him to move property out of his direct ownership, minimizing the risk of asset seizure if an investigation were to be launched. Fortis Group Capital, established just three days before the transaction, appears to be a shell company for asset hiding, while the use of Saeed Javid and a Lisbon-issued power of attorney only complicates tracing the true beneficiaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chernohubov\u2019s story is a textbook case of how pseudomedical \u201cpyramids,\u201d crypto scams, and MLM schemes turn into half-million-dollar apartments. While he \u201ctreats\u201d people of everything under the sun and promises massive returns via cryptocurrency, his real profits end up in real estate \u2014 either registered under his wife\u2019s name or funneled through shady companies. And all this is happening while Ukraine is fighting for its survival and its economy is hanging by a thread. The money earned by exploiting people\u2019s trust doesn\u2019t support the country \u2014 it gets hidden away in luxury properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yevhen Chernohubov is not just a self-proclaimed \u201cinfobusinessman\u201d \u2014 he is a manipulator who feeds off people\u2019s hope for miracles. His projects promise wealth and healing, but leave victims with empty pockets. His pattern of erasing digital traces and transferring assets through shell companies points to fear of accountability. So the real question is \u2014 will law enforcement finally look into these schemes, or will Taryan Towers remain a sanctuary for dirty money?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the stories we\u2019ve uncovered in this article \u2014 and <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/who-lives-in-taryan-towers-how-owners-of-ukraines-most-expensive-apartments-launder-their-dirty-money\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">in the first part of our investigation<\/a> \u2014 clearly show how Ukraine\u2019s most expensive residential complex has become a safe haven for shady capital.

Yet somehow, he continues to enjoy the privileges of a diplomatic passport \u2014 cruising around Dubai, Monaco, and other luxury destinations in expensive cars, and the Ukrainian authorities haven\u2019t said a word.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 1, 2023, the Honorary Consulate of Romania in Kharkiv was officially <a href=\"https:\/\/kharkivoda.gov.ua\/news\/119853\" rel=\"nofollow\">opened<\/a>. The event was attended by Deputy Head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Yevhen Ivanov, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, and Romanian Ambassador to Ukraine Alexandru Victor Micula. They praised the deepening economic cooperation between Romania and the Kharkiv region and emphasized the importance of the new consulate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mykola Udianskyi was appointed as Romania\u2019s Honorary Consul in Kharkiv and introduced as an IT entrepreneur. \u201c<em>Mykola is a well-known and highly respected member of the IT community, especially here in Kharkiv.

And more importantly, where were Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Interior Ministry when they approved Udianskyi\u2019s candidacy, effectively making a criminal a diplomat?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ud1\"><strong>Who Is Mykola Udianskyi?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now 51, Udianskyi was born in Kharkiv and is still officially registered at 5 Zernovyi Lane. He graduated from the Kharkiv National Automobile and Highway University with a degree in Roads and Airfields, and later earned a law and cybersecurity degree from the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs. From 2003 to 2006, he worked as commercial director of Olivin Trading House, a perfume and cosmetics company. After that, he moved into manufacturing and selling payment terminals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1664\" style=\"width:675px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976520_mykola_udyanskiy-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Mykola Udianskyi<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Mykola Udianskyi founded the IT company \u201cProf-it,\u201d which developed cryptocurrency exchanges and other blockchain-based tools.

So what changed? In November 2024, Udianskyi was <a href=\"https:\/\/myrotvorets.center\/criminal\/udianskyi-nykolai-aleksandrovych\/\">added<\/a> to the Myrotvorets database. His profile there cited violations of Ukraine\u2019s citizenship laws and alleged involvement in money laundering through blockchain platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in January 2024, a civil organization called \u201cSorry We\u2019re Alive\u201d submitted a formal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02mortXa4cHjCy4BTG1izx7S4nAXUjAqpAaTFNLa6QLT1sAsiujrBAryKpcmVDTTYgl&amp;id=100064717837703&amp;locale=uk_UA\" rel=\"nofollow\">request<\/a> to Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU), urging them to open a criminal investigation into Udianskyi. Their letter claimed the honorary consul still held russian citizenship, was involved in crypto fraud with convicted partners, had ties to Kharkiv\u2019s criminal underworld, and maintained connections with associates of Chechen leader ramzan kadyrov.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>We believe Mykola Udianskyi\u2019s activities may be coordinated by russian intelligence and pose a threat to Ukraine\u2019s national security<\/em>\u201d, the statement said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these serious accusations, the SBU refused to launch a case or begin an investigation. Finally, in November 2024, the Shevchenkivskyi District Court in Kyiv ordered the SBU to open a case against Udianskyi. The ruling cited five articles of the Criminal Code: 111 (treason), 111-1 (collaboration), 190 (fraud), 209 (money laundering), and 368 (bribery).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as of today, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Ukraine\u2019s public court registry shows no sign of an open investigation or any legal progress on the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ud2\"><strong>How Deep Are Udianskyi\u2019s Ties to russia: Kadyrov\u2019s Inner Circle and a Daughter in russia<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the claims about his russian citizenship and connections to the russian elite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2024, Ukrainian serviceman and journalist Kyrylo Danylchenko <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unian.ua\/society\/pochesniy-konsul-rumuniji-v-harkovi-mikola-udyanskiy-mozhe-mati-rosiyske-gromadyanstvo-dokument-12801999.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">published<\/a> a photo on Facebook showing Mykola Udianskyi\u2019s russian international passport.

But the fact remains \u2014 the honorary consul is literally one handshake away from one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest enemies. And really, what could possibly link a Ukrainian to a Chechen fighter from Kadyrov\u2019s inner circle \u2014 enough to proudly post a photo with him during the sixth year of russia\u2019s war against Ukraine?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s absurd or not, it\u2019s certainly telling: in November 2024, a pro-kremlin Telegram channel published a <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/boilerroomchannel\/21011\" rel=\"nofollow\">post<\/a> claiming that Udianskyi had been meeting unofficially in the U.S. with Trump\u2019s team to help reestablish communication with Ukrainian authorities. The post described Udianskyi as \u201can acceptable intermediary for russia in future U.S.-russia-Ukraine talks,\u201d pointing out that he \u201chas ties to russian elites and hasn\u2019t renounced his russian citizenship\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Kadyrov counts as part of the russian elite, the connection checks out. So does Udianskyi\u2019s joint business with russian partners. In 2021, his company Prof-IT teamed up with the international company Yoola \u2014 founded by russian citizen Fuad Fatullayev \u2014 to create a blockchain platform called WeWay. The platform was managed by a UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk\/company\/13529680\/officers\" rel=\"nofollow\">firm<\/a>, WEWAY GROUP LIMITED, co-founded by Udianskyi\u2019s partner Bohdan Prilepa and Fatullayev himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Udianskyi publicly distanced himself from WeWay \u2014 likely because of Fatullayev\u2019s russian citizenship \u2014 and claimed to have left the project.

As mentioned before, in 2016 he launched his own cryptocurrency \u2014 E-DinarCoin. In reality, it was nothing more than a \u201ccrypto-financial pyramid scheme\u201d that the so-called \u201ccrypto visionary\u201d promoted while living in Indonesia. He first targeted people there, then expanded to Ghana and Nigeria. Eventually, E-DinarCoin opened offices in Ukraine, China \u2014 and, of course, russia. The project\u2019s Russian-language Instagram page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/edinarcoin.rus?igsh=MXJoZW95YnRyYzQzZw==\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edinarcoin.rus<\/a> is still online, where Udianskyi promoted the scheme \u2014 even using a photo of former russian president <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BMee_U4j60w\/?igsh=bDRtZmJzcGJ0MGgx\" rel=\"nofollow\">dmitry medvedev<\/a> to boost its image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Udianskyi tried every trick to lure people into investing in his coin. E-DinarCoin presentations were full of flashy promises and dreams of a wealthy life. Sponsored articles appeared in top media outlets in Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ukraine \u2014 without any \u201cadvertisement\u201d labels. While living in Bali, Udianskyi even gave away $10,000 prizes to those who joined the scheme. He claimed that investments in E-DinarCoin were insured by a company called Assur \u2014 which, as noted earlier, he himself had created and controlled. Unsurprisingly, no one ever received a single payout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading of E-DinarCoin began in March 2017 at a starting price of $0.25. But by July, it had dropped below $0.01. Despite mounting problems with exchanges and payments, Udianskyi kept pushing the project \u2014 until it finally shut down in 2020. All investor funds vanished. The company \u201cEdinarcoin\u201d was later transferred to Udianskyi\u2019s partner from the insurance company Assur \u2014 Yurii Poltavskyi. He\u2019s a convicted criminal serving 8 years in prison for armed robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drug trafficking, and causing bodily harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ud4\"><strong>How Udianskyi Cashed In on the Miya Holding Scheme<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The E-DinarCoin case is actually one of the more &#171;harmless&#187; scams pulled off by Ukraine\u2019s honorary Romanian consul in Kharkiv. The Miya Holding story is a whole other level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August 2020, a group of unknown individuals launched a Ponzi scheme under the name Miya.holding. The scheme was disguised as an investment opportunity in a ride-hailing and home appliance business. Victims were promised passive income based on the amount they invested and how many new members they brought in. A classic referral scam \u2014 bring a friend, earn more \u2014 and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funds were accepted through crypto and low-verification payment systems, making them harder to trace. Investors were told they\u2019d earn 0.9% per day from the value of their digital \u201ccertificates.\u201d An absurd rate that should have raised red flags for anyone with basic financial sense. But the profits weren\u2019t real \u2014 they were just digital points displayed in users\u2019 accounts. And there were a lot of them \u2014 over 55,000 people joined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early 2021, when users tried to withdraw their \u201cprofits,\u201d it didn\u2019t work. The organizers blamed \u201ctechnical issues\u201d. Then they pulled the next trick \u2014 converting users\u2019 fake \u201cMiya\u201d points into a new cryptocurrency called Eva. They claimed it was being traded on the Coinsbit crypto exchange owned by Mykola Udianskyi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian law enforcement later revealed that the Miya.holding scammers had made a deal with Coinsbit. According to case \u2116 1202100000000365 from March 4, 2021, the scammers listed Eva at a fake exchange rate of 1 Eva = 1 USD \u2014 while its real value was closer to $0.0005.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This inflated price was achieved by manipulating the market. Udianskyi allegedly gave Miya\u2019s organizers permission to \u201ctrade\u201d Eva on his exchange, where they themselves bought and sold it at fake prices \u2014 just to make the project look legit. In return, Udianskyi reportedly took a cut of the money flowing into the Ponzi scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But soon after the scheme had likely pulled in enough cash, <em>Eva<\/em> crashed. Most exchanges stopped accepting it, and investors lost everything. Then, on March 20, 2021, Udianskyi\u2019s crypto exchange Coinsbit blocked users from withdrawing Eva from their personal accounts on the website<a href=\"https:\/\/miyaholding.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> miyaholding.com<\/a> to the exchange, effectively cutting off any chance of getting their money back. Neat, isn\u2019t it? Not so neat that instead of ending up in jail, Mykola Udianskyi landed in a diplomatic seat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ud5\"><strong>How Udianskyi and His Partner Bohdan Prylepa Cashed In on Drones for the Armed Forces<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And even this isn\u2019t the worst part. In addition to Coinsbit \u2014 a crypto exchange registered in the Seychelles in 2020 \u2014 Mykola Udianskyi and his longtime friend and business partner Bohdan Prylepa, with whom he launched <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prof-it\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prof-it <\/a>back in 2013, also founded two more exchanges: Tidex, registered in the Cayman Islands, and QMall, registered in Lithuania in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"761\" height=\"517\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976500_bohdan_prilepa.jpeg\" alt=\"Ukrainian crypto businessman Bohdan Prylepa wearing a polo shirt, city skyline in the background\" class=\"wp-image-1669\" style=\"width:570px;height:auto\" title=\"A young man with a beard wearing a polo shirt, city skyline in the background\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976500_bohdan_prilepa.jpeg 761w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976500_bohdan_prilepa-300x204.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bohdan Prylepa<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In late April 2024, Ukraine\u2019s National Police, together with the Kyiv City Prosecutor\u2019s Office, launched criminal case No. 120241000000000540 under Part 4 of Article 190 of the Criminal Code \u2014 large-scale fraud committed by an organized group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to investigators, crypto exchange founders Mykola Udianskyi and Bohdan Prilepa scammed Ukrainian and foreign investors \u2014 including citizens of the EU and the U.S. \u2014 out of large sums of money. They allegedly did so with help from members of the russian criminal underworld, who helped them operate freely in the UAE and the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation identified at least 10 Ukrainian citizens who lost a total of 51,911 USDT on the QMall exchange because of fraudulent activity by Udianskyi and Prilepa. But the worst part came later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 13, 2023, Udianskyi and Prilepa allegedly stole $390,000 that had been held on QMall. The funds were specifically raised to finance FPV drone production for the Ukrainian military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A witness from the Armed Forces of Ukraine testified that he had arranged with Mykola Udianskyi for $500,000 in USDT to be sent to Udianskyi\u2019s QMall account by foreign donors. The funds were intended to cover drone production. But after $110,000 was successfully withdrawn in December 2023, the rest of the account \u2014 and all remaining funds \u2014 was blocked. Apparently, by Udianskyi himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what did the Honorary Consul of Romania in Kharkiv do? He tried to shift the blame onto his partner. When questioned by investigators, Udianskyi claimed that Prilepa had cut him out of decision-making at the exchanges. He also said that Prilepa gave instructions to two Ukrainian nationals \u2014 Andrii Saranenko and Pavlo Shydlovskyi \u2014 who were responsible for technical operations at the exchanges, including money transfers. According to Udianskyi, they were the ones who blocked his account holding the drone funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several witnesses \u2014 all former employees of Udianskyi\u2019s Prof-it company \u2014 backed up his version of events. Unsurprisingly, they all appear to be close to Udianskyi. One of them, Yaroslav Vikhariev, is listed in contacts on GetContact as \u201cYaroslav from Kolia Udianskyi\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the problem: Udianskyi and Prilepa only had their supposed \u201cfalling out\u201d after criminal charges were filed \u2014 in 2024. All through 2023, the two were still appearing side by side in puff pieces and PR campaigns promoting their donations to the military. Then, once prosecutors launched their investigation, suddenly <a href=\"https:\/\/antikor.com.ua\/articles\/740252-bogdan_prilepa_hertva_vlastej_ili_aferist_obmanuvshij_tysjachi_ljudej\" rel=\"nofollow\">only<\/a> Prilepa started getting named in shady clickbait <a href=\"https:\/\/antikor.com.ua\/ru\/articles\/644363-bogdan_prilepa_i_nikolaj_udjanskij_masshtaby_lukavstva_stroitelej_kriptopiramid\" rel=\"nofollow\">articles<\/a> on scammy websites like Antikor \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/hto-stoyit-za-sajtom-antykor-shho-vymagaye-po-12-tysyach-dolariv-za-vydalennya-naklepu\/\">a site known for blackmailing people to pay $12,000<\/a> to remove defamatory articles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Udianskyi began giving <a href=\"https:\/\/uazmi.org\/news\/post\/1b5fd96aff5d8a390982fa8c9602f48d\" rel=\"nofollow\">interviews<\/a> where he painted himself as the victim and pinned all responsibility on Prilepa. Notably, Udianskyi didn\u2019t say a word about this back in December 2023 \u2014 when the funds for the military disappeared from his exchange. He only \u201cspoke up\u201d nearly a year later, once law enforcement got involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: the Honorary Consul of Romania decided to save his own reputation \u2014 by throwing his partner under the bus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ud6\"><strong>Luxury Cars and Real Estate Abroad: The Lavish Lifestyle of Consul Udianskyi<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And it seems Udianskyi has pulled it off. Despite the scandals, criminal cases, and extensive ties to russia, he still holds his diplomatic title. One curious detail: in September 2023, the Honorary Consul of Romania in Kharkiv suddenly sold all of his Ukrainian real estate. That included two apartments in Kharkiv and another apartment with a parking space in central Kyiv, at 70-A Saksahanskoho Street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning to leave the country, perhaps? If so, he already has a destination lined up. Back in 2019, Udianskyi issued a power of attorney to purchase an apartment in Thailand \u2014 specifically, in the city of Phuket, at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.planetofhotels.com\/thailand\/phuket-town\/title-condo-rawai-beach\" rel=\"nofollow\">456\/222 Moo6 Rawai Muang<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976507_budynok_mykoly_udyanskogo_v_tailandi-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Four-story modern building near a resort area, surrounded by palm trees\" class=\"wp-image-1670\" style=\"width:591px;height:auto\" title=\"Four-story modern building near a resort area, surrounded by palm trees\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976507_budynok_mykoly_udyanskogo_v_tailandi-1024x768.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976507_budynok_mykoly_udyanskogo_v_tailandi-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976507_budynok_mykoly_udyanskogo_v_tailandi-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976507_budynok_mykoly_udyanskogo_v_tailandi.png 1198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The building in Thailand where Udianskyi is believed to have purchased an apartment in 2019<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, according to official registries, Mykola Udianskyi owns only one vehicle in Ukraine \u2014 a 2022 Lexus LX 500D. However, in July 2024, he issued a power of attorney authorizing a representative to purchase a car abroad on his behalf. This move strongly suggests that Udianskyi was seriously planning to flee the country, likely due to an ongoing criminal investigation into cryptocurrency exchange scams. Yet it seems he managed to \u201csettle\u201d the issue with law enforcement, at least for now \u2014 the escape plan appears to be on hold. Still, it\u2019s clear that the honorary consul has no intention of tying his future to Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s especially evident from the number of trips he\u2019s made abroad. Officially, he only obtained legal grounds to leave Ukraine in May 2023, when a court acknowledged he had three children \u2014 despite the fact that his eldest daughter lives in russia. Nevertheless, Udianskyi freely traveled throughout 2022, visiting Dubai, Spain, Monaco, France, Italy, and Switzerland. In 2023 and 2024, he vacationed in Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and also made trips to Romania, presumably for his consular duties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His wife also doesn\u2019t seem eager to stay in Ukraine under missile attacks.

Despite that, she is often seen driving a more luxurious car \u2014 a 2022 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S580 with the flashy license plate AX7777TH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That vehicle is registered to a company named Baumann LLC. Its co-owners include Valeriia Hulchuk \u2014 the wife of Mykola Udianskyi\u2019s brother Andrii, who appears in contact apps as \u201cUdianskyi\u2019s Chief Accountant\u201d and \u201cApartment from Kolia Udianskyi\u201d \u2014 and A.A. Zaslavskyi, Mykola\u2019s father-in-law. In August 2023, the honorary consul\u2019s wife was seen <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cvc8MzZNsEU\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">driving<\/a> this same Maybach around Monaco. The company also owns a Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG with license plate KH0001PP, a vehicle used by the Udianskyi family as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"789\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976513_mercedes_benz_maybach_s580_mercedes_benz_g_63_amg_udyanskii-789x1024.png\" alt=\"Black Mercedes-Benz Maybach S580 and Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG vehicles\n\" class=\"wp-image-1672\" style=\"width:630px;height:auto\" title=\"Black Mercedes-Benz Maybach S580 and Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG vehicles\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976513_mercedes_benz_maybach_s580_mercedes_benz_g_63_amg_udyanskii-789x1024.png 789w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976513_mercedes_benz_maybach_s580_mercedes_benz_g_63_amg_udyanskii-231x300.png 231w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976513_mercedes_benz_maybach_s580_mercedes_benz_g_63_amg_udyanskii-768x997.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/cleaned1744976513_mercedes_benz_maybach_s580_mercedes_benz_g_63_amg_udyanskii.png 912w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Mercedes-Benz Maybach S580 and Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG registered to Baumann LLC \u2014 used by the Udianskyi family \u2014 spotted in Monaco in August 2023<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A lavish lifestyle like this requires serious income. And considering that most of Udianskyi\u2019s cryptocurrency ventures eventually failed, the conclusion seems obvious: this luxury was funded through scams and fraudulent schemes run by the honorary consul of Romania in Kharkiv.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the assets listed above are just a portion of what Udianskyi is believed to own. According to some sources, he also possesses real estate in the United Arab Emirates and Montenegro. In fact, in 2019, Ukrainian law enforcement discovered Leonid Mytrov \u2014 the fugitive leader of the Zalyutynski organized crime group \u2014 hiding in Udianskyi\u2019s Montenegrin residence. He was later extradited to Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s just one chapter in the curious life of this Kharkiv-based diplomat.

His old panel apartment was replaced by a luxury unit in the \u201cFrantsuzkyi Kvartal 2\u201d complex, and instead of using public transportation, he began acquiring luxury cars.

Vladyslav likely got a certificate saying he\u2019s unfit for military service, allowing him to live a carefree life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vlad4\"><strong>What is Vladyslav Myroshnychenko\u2019s official income?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to open registry data, after moving to Kyiv on September 13, 2022, Vladyslav registered a <a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/fop_details\/45827654\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sole proprietorship<\/a> with 35 activities listed, including bread production, restaurants, sports clubs, advertising, and computer programming as his main activity. But what does Myroshnychenko actually do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our research shows that his sole proprietorship only worked with other businesses, mostly in the restaurant and catering sector. However, there is no evidence that Myroshnychenko is actually involved in the restaurant business. This means that all transactions and deals conducted through this sole proprietorship are likely fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what proves this. Vladyslav Myroshnychenko\u2019s official income was 694,000 UAH ($18,980) in 2022, 5,216,346 UAH ($138,900) in 2023, and only 4,000 UAH ($100) in 2024 as of September. His 2023 income is almost the same as the $137,240 he spent on two parking spaces in the \u201cTriiinity\u201d residential complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to prove income to buy cars, but it\u2019s required for financial checks when buying real estate. Myroshnychenko likely used his sole proprietorship to explain the money, running it through fake deals for restaurant and catering services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s strange that a \u201csuccessful\u201d business making over 5 million UAH in 2023 earned only $100 in 2024. Even more unusual, Vladyslav managed to buy two luxury cars for himself and one for his girlfriend this year, while officially living on just $100 for the past nine months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gap between the former bartender\u2019s income and expenses has now reached at least $1.4 million. In other words, Vladyslav Myroshnychenko spends 10 times more than he earns. And this doesn\u2019t even include his lavish trips abroad on private jets and helicopters, photos of which he shares on Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"687\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718478_vlad_myroshnychenko_gelikoptery-1024x687.png\" alt=\"While traveling across Europe, he prefers to get around by private helicopters.

His Instagram account, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nobodyknows.satoshi?igsh=OHIyeGk1dzh4aWpw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nobodyknows.satoshi<\/a>, links to another page called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mirrorreflection.hub\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mirror Reflection<\/a> \u2014 a project offering courses on cryptocurrency trading, teaching how to buy and sell crypto for profit. According to public records, Myroshnychenko founded this company in March 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/mirror-reflection.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">project\u2019s website<\/a> offers several courses for purchase. Beginners can choose the &#8220;Crypto from Zero&#8221; course for $399. For those seeking personalized guidance, the &#8220;1&#215;1&#8221; course costs $4,999 and includes a personal mentor to guide them throughout their cryptocurrency trading journey. Additionally, a subscription to &#8220;Networks&#8221; is available for $99 per month, providing advice from experienced traders on navigating the cryptocurrency market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project mainly sells educational services. According to the website\u2019s public offer agreement, these services are provided by LLC &#8220;Industrial Retail,&#8221; owned and directed by Vladyslav Myroshnychenko. The company is registered at a Kharkiv apartment near the industrial zone, where Vladyslav, his mother, and his brother also live are also registered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/c\/44287723\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpendataBot<\/a>, this LLC was called &#8220;Kokhnivskyi Karier&#8221; until January 2024, and its main activity is still listed as timber trading. The company has only one employee \u2014 Vladyslav Myroshnychenko \u2014 and reported zero profit for 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, Vladyslav presents Mirror Reflection as a successful company with at least two offices \u2014 one in Kyiv\u2019s Pecherskyi district and another in Spain. He has shared photos of these offices on his Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it turns out that this, too, is just as fake as Myroshnychenko\u2019s sole proprietorship. The supposed Mirror Reflection office in Pechersk is actually the office of Vostok Bank, located at 26 Lesi Ukrainky Boulevard. Myroshnychenko simply replaced the bank\u2019s sign with his project\u2019s logo using Photoshop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"747\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718406_ofis_mirror_reflection_bank_vostok-1024x747.png\" alt=\"On his social media, Vladyslav Myroshnychenko presents the Vostok Bank office in Kyiv as the office of his company, Mirror Reflection\" class=\"wp-image-1157\" title=\"On his social media, Vladyslav Myroshnychenko presents the Vostok Bank office in Kyiv as the office of his company, Mirror Reflection\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718406_ofis_mirror_reflection_bank_vostok-1024x747.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718406_ofis_mirror_reflection_bank_vostok-300x219.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718406_ofis_mirror_reflection_bank_vostok-768x560.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/cleaned1727718406_ofis_mirror_reflection_bank_vostok.png 1026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>On his social media, Vladyslav Myroshnychenko presents the Vostok Bank office in Kyiv as the office of his company, Mirror Reflection<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The photo of the Mirror Reflection office in Spain is actually a picture of a bike shop called Bike Center Astoria.

Even if he does make money from selling cryptocurrency trading courses, it clearly doesn\u2019t go through LLC &#8220;Industrial Retail,&#8221; which has no registered employees.

The company, created on February 20, 2024, focuses on renting and managing real estate. Its authorized capital is 16.53 million UAH. This company also seems to be fake, as it has no financial reports or income data. But the co-founders are what make it fascinating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, 30-year-old Kharkiv native Yevhenii Trusov.

Yevhen has spent his life in sports and worked as a security guard, driver, rehabilitation specialist, and trainer \u2014 none of which involve office work. We\u2019ll talk more about what these \u201cOffices\u201d tags might mean later. For now, let\u2019s focus on what Trusov has been doing since russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 13, 2022, Yevhen Trusov registered a <a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/fop_details\/67191694\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sole proprietorship<\/a> with computer programming as its main activity. On the exact same day, Vladyslav Myroshnychenko registered his sole proprietorship with the same type of activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 18, 2023, Trusov started <a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/company_details\/45206493\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LLC &#8220;Bilyardna<\/a>&#8221; which is officially listed as providing restaurant and mobile catering services. However, it has no employees and earned no income in 2023. On February 10, 2023, he founded a charitable organization called &#8220;Fund 1654,&#8221; and on May 11, 2024, he became a co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/company_details\/45357251\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LLC &#8220;Eco Sapropel&#8221;<\/a> which produces fertilizers and nitrogen compounds. Then, on June 7, 2024, he registered another company, LLC &#8220;Community Cloud Keeper,&#8221; listed as an advertising agency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of companies Trusov, an athlete and former security guard, has registered \u2014 with such unrelated activities, plus a charitable fund \u2014 suggests these businesses are likely fake and created to legalize unofficial income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three days before Vladyslav Myroshnychenko and Yevhen Trusov simultaneously registered their sole proprietorships, on September 10, 2022, another co-founder of LLC &#8220;Ikigai Group,&#8221; Vitalii Dukhopelov, did the same. Also a Kharkiv native, Dukhopelov is now, according to the Real Estate Ownership Registry, the owner of two garages (Nos. 114 and 115) in one of Kyiv\u2019s most expensive residential complexes, &#8220;Boulevard of Fountains.&#8221; His <a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/fop_details\/73124404\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sole proprietorship<\/a> is officially listed under restaurant and mobile catering services. It\u2019s likely that Myroshnychenko uses Dukhopelov\u2019s sole proprietorship for money laundering through fake contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 8, 2023, Myroshnychenko\u2019s associate started LLC &#8220;Success Ads,&#8221; which is listed as an advertising company. However, financial reports show it\u2019s running at a loss. Despite this, he owns a 2021 Audi SQ8 worth $80,000 to $100,000. According to BlackBox OSINT, he lent the car to Vladyslav Myroshnychenko in February 2023 for a trip abroad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most intriguing figure in Myroshnychenko\u2019s circle is another co-founder of LLC &#8220;Ikigai Group&#8221; \u2014 39-year-old Kharkiv resident Mykhailo Uvarov, originally from Murmansk, russia, and nicknamed &#8220;Frantsuz.&#8221; Like Myroshnychenko, Trusov, and Dukhopelov, he registered a sole proprietorship on September 13, 2022, with computer programming as the main activity. Uvarov also founded his own company, LLC &#8220;Impact Innovation,&#8221; on June 5, 2024, with the same listed activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uvarov has a complicated past. In late 2018, he was known by his original surname, Kuritsyn (changed to Uvarov in 2021), and was wanted by police for large-scale theft committed with an accomplice. In 2019, two criminal cases \u2014 No. 12018220480004858 and No. 12019220510000478 \u2014 were opened against Uvarov and his partner in the Dzerzhynskyi District Court of Kharkiv under Part 4 of Article 185 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

Since he never went to prison and later became one of Vladyslav Myroshnychenko\u2019s business partners, this seems likely to be true. It looks like he never faced real punishment for his crimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mykhailo Uvarov is also known in Kharkiv for domestic violence against his wife, Kateryna Uvarova. In December 2021, a <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/truexanewsua\/20866\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">video taken by passersby<\/a> showed an incident in Freedom Square, Kharkiv. Uvarov\u2019s BMW X5 stopped in the middle of the road, and Kateryna was screaming, \u201cLet me go!\u201d as she tried to escape from him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2022, Kateryna posted a <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/truexanewsua\/22335\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">video<\/a> online asking for help. She said Uvarov had been threatening and abusing her for five years. \u201cI can\u2019t escape because he promises to kill or hurt me if I try,\u201d she said.Police later <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/truexanewsua\/22383\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">detained<\/a> Uvarov at a kindergarten where he came to pick up his children. He was reportedly banned from seeing them, but the case didn\u2019t go any further. Uvarov has also been involved in other cases, including domestic violence, theft, and other crimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vlad7\"><strong>Are Vladyslav Myroshnychenko and his friends engaged in fraud through Illegal call centers?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the GetContact app, Uvarov\u2019s phone number is saved by some as \u201cMysha Sanya Crypto\u201d and \u201cMysha Office.\u201d Similarly, another co-founder of &#8220;Ikigai Group,&#8221; Yevhen Trusov, is listed as \u201cZhenia Office Kharkiv\u201d and \u201cZhenia Offices.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/public-investigationsen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">According to BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, Mykhailo \u201cFrantsuz\u201d Uvarov runs illegal call centers that scam people into sending money through fraudulent schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraudsters often call such call centers \u201coffices,\u201d which could explain why Trusov, who has spent his life in sports and never worked in an office, is tagged this way.

Another theory is that he earns money from his cryptocurrency project, Mirror Reflection. Together with Prokhor Huz\u2019, Myroshnychenko <a href=\"https:\/\/iprop-ua.com\/tm\/69pg7ilf\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">applied<\/a> to register the trademark <a href=\"https:\/\/mssg.me\/mirrorreflection\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExBid<\/a>, a cryptocurrency exchange operating in Kharkiv and Kyiv. This service is connected to Mirror Reflection, and the income from it seems to disappear into cryptocurrency, avoiding taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the companies where Myroshnychenko is a founder or co-founder show any financial activity. The only income comes from his sole proprietorship, but as we\u2019ve said, it officially earns 10 times less than the 26-year-old &#8220;crypto expert&#8221; spends. This means most of his money, wherever it comes from, isn\u2019t taxed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that former bartenders, hookah workers, drivers, rehabilitation specialists, and thieves all registered identical sole proprietorships on the same day and suddenly became programmers, crypto experts, and traders raises many questions. These are questions that should be investigated by law enforcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do young men, who were unknown until recently, suddenly get millions of dollars during the war? How can they afford luxury cars, private jet trips, and expensive jewelry for their girlfriends?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s time for the tax authorities and the Economic Security Bureau (ESBU) to investigate these cryptocurrency traders, especially when the country is raising taxes to cover its wartime budget while they spend money without limits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>launched a criminal investigation against Oleksandr Slobozhenko, a blogger and owner of Traffic Devils.

It is the company whose portfolio includes dating and gambling websites as well as scientific startups and social educational projects.&nbsp;<em>Noosphere Ventures<\/em>&nbsp;belongs to Maksym Poliakov, a well-known Ukrainian entrepreneur from Zaporizhzhia city who was ranked 11<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;by Forbes in the list of the richest Ukrainians with a fortune of UAH800 million in 2022.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the outbreak of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Snopko moved to the Czech Republic where, according to her friends, she&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/forbes.ua\/ru\/inside\/znayomtesya-noviy-mediakholding-u-deloua-ta-glavkom-nova-vlasnitsya-tetyana-snopko-navishcho-tse-kolishniy-menedzhertsi-maksa-polyakova-ta-maksa-krippi-02082023-15183\">was even looking for a job<\/a>&nbsp;but already at the end of 2022 she started buying up the Ukrainian media and registering limited liability companies with a millions worth nominal capital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Snopko had got almost a minimum wage at&nbsp;<em>Noosphere<\/em>&nbsp;\u2014 according to the tax service,&nbsp;<em>Noosphere<\/em> NGO paid her UAH 6300 t\u043e UAH 13,500 a month during 2018-2021. However, it wasn\u2019t her only income. Since 2013, Snopko has been working as an individual entrepreneur in the area of&nbsp;<em>Data Processing, Publishing Information on Websites and Related Activities<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to her tax declarations, three companies, namely&nbsp;<em>TT Media<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Payment Work<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>PM Plus Media&nbsp;<\/em>LLCs, paid her a year\u2019s total of UAH 928,000 in 2018, UAH 1,045,000 in 2019, UAH 1,102,000 in 2020, and UAH 944,000 in 2021. That is for the last four years before the full-scale war when Snopko looked for a job in the Czech Republic, she had managed to earn about UAH4 million. Given the fact that she was likely using this money for living all this time, it is far from enough to buy several media at once and register companies with a total nominal capital of UAH 13 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moneyfrom\"><strong>Where is the Tetiana Snopko&#8217;s Money from?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tetiana Snopko refused to answer this question when giving her comments to Forbes. Speaking of why she needed the mentioned media, she admitted herself that it was impossible to earn money off the media as business nowadays. \u2018I can even tell you that the market is wild. It doesn\u2019t exist\u2026 I\u2019m from the IT industry, and for me the media is primarily a product, a platform, working with traffic. It is a digital asset in the first place,\u2019 she said without explaining what it meant and what the point of making such purchases these days was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our sources from&nbsp;<em>Glavcom<\/em>\u2019s editorial staff shed some light on this picture revealing us that Snopko wasn\u2019t the final beneficiary of the purchased media but more likely a mediator, an \u201cappointee\u201d. The actual buyer of all the mentioned media is entrepreneur Maksym Krippa who has been barely known up until recently.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/3.png\" alt=\"Maksym Krippa\" class=\"wp-image-275\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1;width:445px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/3.png 625w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/3-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/3-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Maksym Krippa<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Maksym Krippa is a long-term partner of Maksym Poliakov, Tetiana Snopko\u2019s former employer.

When asked directly about her relations with him, she answered that he was just the man she knows and described their cooperation as a \u201cconsultation\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of internet resources indicate that Maksym Krippa and Maksym Poliakov were developing the gambling and online dating business together in the early 2010s. As of 2013, Krippa and Poliakov&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/players.com.ua\/ru\/news\/kto-takoj-maksim-krippa-potenczialnyj-novyj-vladelecz-navi\/\">owned<\/a>&nbsp;<em>GGS<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>GMS<\/em>&nbsp;online casinos which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/forbes.ua\/ru\/inside\/znayomtesya-noviy-mediakholding-u-deloua-ta-glavkom-nova-vlasnitsya-tetyana-snopko-navishcho-tse-kolishniy-menedzhertsi-maksa-polyakova-ta-maksa-krippi-02082023-15183\">confirmed<\/a>&nbsp;by the materials in the court case at the time on the division of assets with their Russian partners Sergey Tokarev and Rustam Gilfanov. Later on, Poliakov and Krippa started organizing online casinos under&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n&nbsp;<\/em>brand and actively developing the latter in many countries, including Ukraine where gambling was prohibited until 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why, in 2016, the Main Investigation Department of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) initiated criminal proceeding No. 22015000000000379 under Article 203-2, clause 1, Article 203-2 (<em>Illegal Gambling Activity<\/em>), and clause 2, Article 258-5 (<em>Funding Terrorism<\/em>) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The investigation found out that despite the gambling prohibition in Ukraine Poliakov Maksym Valeriiovych and Krippa Maksym Volodymyrovych created a range of websites (www.vulkan-champion.co\/ru\/ru, www.casino-club-online.com, www.casino-velcam.com,&nbsp;<strong>www.vulkan-russia.com&nbsp;<\/strong>and www.vulcanoriginals.com) under&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n&nbsp;<\/em>brand and used them to provide online casino services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the SSU\u2019s information, Poliakov was the actual founder and investor of&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;online casino, while Maksym Krippa was the CEO of&nbsp;<em>CloneFish&nbsp;<\/em>IT company that developed games for online-casinos and administered and maintained&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n&nbsp;<\/em>websites as well as protected them from electronic interferences by the authorities. In 2014,&nbsp;<em>CloneFish<\/em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/evoplay.com\/news\/evoplay-purchased-clonefish-what-is-there-to-expect\/\">became part<\/a>&nbsp;of another Maksym Krippa\u2019s company&nbsp;<em>EvoPlay<\/em>&nbsp;which is still developing games for online casinos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, to legalize the gambling money Maksym Poliakov, as the criminal proceeding materials suggest, together with his companions Ihor Spodin and Ihor Boshniakov created in Dnipro an organization called&nbsp;<em>Association Noosphere&nbsp;<\/em>(where Tetiana Snopko worked) and&nbsp;<em>Avrora Tecnologies&nbsp;<\/em>LLC whose current bank accounts received the money that was earned from the illegal activity of&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n&nbsp;<\/em>online casino and \u2018further transferred to other dummy-like companies\u2019 accounts. It was then cashed and distributed among those involved in this criminal activity.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, a number of resolutions of the Shevchenkivskyi District Court of Kyiv City dated January 2017 imply that a part of money siphoned to the offshore companies controlled by Maksym Poliakov was further processed and transferred to fund the&nbsp;<em>Donetsk and Luhansk People&#8217;s Republics<\/em>. That was obviously the reason why&nbsp;<em>Funding Terrorism<\/em>&nbsp;was the second clause in the criminal proceeding. We don\u2019t know how this case has ended. Taking into account that there are no other related documents in open registers and the fact that in case of several other legal actions connected with Maksym Krippa (particularly regarding tax violations and drunk driving) he managed to evade responsibility, Poliakov and Krippa are most likely to have got away with it in this case as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vulkansrussianroots\"><strong><em>Vulk@n<\/em>\u2019s Russian Roots<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ukraine, after the resolution on legalizing the gambling market had been approved in 2020, it wasn\u2019t big news that the lion\u2019s share (mostly shadow) of this market was gamblers with Russian roots. In 2022, the Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries had already granted licenses for working in Ukraine to the Russian bookmaker&nbsp;<em>1xBet<\/em>&nbsp;that tried to disguise as a Ukrainian company titled&nbsp;<em>Your Betting Company&nbsp;<\/em>LLC. The public reaction made the Commission revoke the issued licenses but nobody promised to keep other Russian gambling business representatives away from our market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>April 15, 2021,&nbsp;<em>Conqueror&nbsp;<\/em>LLC obtained from the Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries a license to provide online casino services under&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n&nbsp;<\/em>brand at vulkancasino.ua.&nbsp;<em>Conqueror&nbsp;<\/em>LLC is registered for offshore company&nbsp;<em>Darlox Ltd&nbsp;<\/em>(99.9%) and Stanislav Rudenko (0.1%), a native of Nizhyn city, Chernihiv oblast. However, before 2021, the beneficiary of&nbsp;<em>Conqueror&nbsp;<\/em>LLC was Cyprian resident Theodor Theodoros (Fedor Fedorov), the founder of&nbsp;<em>Novologic<\/em>&nbsp;company whose CEO in 2010-2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/data-research\/hralnyy-biznes-2023\/\">according to<\/a>&nbsp;YouControl system, was Maksym Krippa. Just two months before getting a license for working in Ukraine,&nbsp;<em>Conqueror&nbsp;<\/em>LLC removed Theodor Theodoros from its founders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/iprop-ua.com\/tm\/w5wi0ifx\/\">the owner of&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;trademark<\/a>&nbsp;in Ukraine is Cyprian company&nbsp;<em>DAREOS LTD<\/em>.

In the Russian Federation, his lottery was called&nbsp;<em>Pobeda<\/em>&nbsp;[<em>Victory<\/em>] and as it turned out its income was used to support the Russian army which at the time had already annexed Ukrainian Crimea and waged a war in Donbas. In 2016,&nbsp;<em>Patriot<\/em>&nbsp;private joint-stock company&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/lb.ua\/economics\/2015\/09\/17\/316194_lotozabava_popala_pod_sanktsii_.html\">was sanctioned<\/a>&nbsp;by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine \u2018considering the involvement with Russian businessmen and possible funding of the Russian army.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in summer 2015, the law-enforcement bodies conducted a search of the&nbsp;<em>EvoPlay<\/em>&nbsp;office in 1, Naberezhno-Pecherska Street, Kyiv, on suspicion of working for Russian oligarch Oleg Boyko. The search confiscated the server with data on the company\u2019s activities, a part of office equipment, gambling machines, accounting documents with several dozens of seals and stamps of different firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018A part of income from&nbsp;<em>EvoPlay<\/em>&nbsp;activities obviously went directly to Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko since&nbsp;<em>Ritzio International<\/em>&nbsp;he owns has the exclusive agreement with&nbsp;<em>EvoPlay<\/em>&nbsp;for representing its assets in the gambling sector, namely&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;trademark under which slot machine clubs worked in the past,\u2019 the media reported back then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is only half a year after the journalists had published information that Russian businessman Oleg Boyko, a Ukrainian lottery owner, directed his earnings to fund the Russian aggression against Ukraine, Poliakov and Krippa became partners with Boyko, received rights from him to use&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;brand and started managing the casino websites in his interests implying a regular fixed payment or some percent from income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"empirenavi\"><strong>The Empire Expands.&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>MainCast<\/em><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As it\u2019s been already mentioned, Maksym Krippa has been recently trying to hide this story and his ties with the Russian gambling market, cleaning up any mentions of him in connection with&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;casino on the internet. And that\u2019s understandable \u2014 building business in Ukraine with such past in the conditions of the Russian aggressive war would be hard, to say the least. We have to admit that to some extent Krippa has managed to foul his trail and start buying up Ukrainian companies, real estate and the media with the money he earned in the Russian gambling industry without attracting attention to himself as a business partner of the Russian oligarch who supports aggression against Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, in July 2022, Maksym Krippa&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.ua\/ru\/news\/navi-crippa-1664371567\">became the owner<\/a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;esports brand, the club whose teams have earned $18.7 million of prize money for 12 years. The company\u2019s founder and owner was Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi whom Russian Forbes called one of the most influential people in the post-Soviet esports in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the criticism,&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;didn\u2019t think, either before its owner had changed or after it, that there were any problems with Russian players being part of its teams who are still present in&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;rosters. For example, Russians Andrey Kiprsky, Dmitry Ilyushin, Artem Adarkin and Aleksandr Pirogov are still listed on the&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;website as players in&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>teams. On June 20, 2022, in the middle of the Russia\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine,&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;on its website&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/navi.gg\/ua\/publications\/pubg-changes-june-22\">informed<\/a>that it returned Ivan Kapustin to its team without saying a word about the fact that he was Russian. And in November 2022,&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ua-football.com\/cybersport\/other\/1668981269-navi-ctali-chempionami-pubg-global-championship-2022.html\">was reported<\/a>&nbsp;to have won&nbsp;<em>PUBG Global Championship 2022<\/em>&nbsp;in Dubai earning over $1 million of prize money, and the tournament\u2019s best player who got additional $10,000 was Artem Adarkin, a citizen of the Russian Federation and a player of Ukrainian&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kokhanovskyi\u2019s and Krippa\u2019s soft position towards Russia is there for a reason. In 2018, Kokhanovskyi was a co-owner of&nbsp;<em>ESForce<\/em>, the third largest enterprise funded by&nbsp;<em>USM Holdings<\/em>&nbsp;belonging to Alisher Usmanov, a Russian oligarch close to Putin, who&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/dota2.net\/news\/25835-alisher-usmanov-kibersport-menya-voobshche-ne-interesuet\">invested<\/a>&nbsp;$100 million in Kokhanovskyi\u2019s project in 2015.&nbsp;<em>ESForce<\/em>&nbsp;was bought by the Russian company&nbsp;<em>Mail.ru Group<\/em>&nbsp;in 2018. Kokhanovskyi\u2019s partner from ESForce was Anton Cherepennikov, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Citadel<\/em>&nbsp;system that helps the Russian special services track internet users\u2019 activity and monitor telephone conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was not unusual for either Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi or Maksym Krippa to have relationships with a Russian businessman. Probably that\u2019s why&nbsp;<em>1xBet<\/em>, the notorious Russian bookmaker, was&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>\u2019s title sponsor in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnership between Kokhanovskyi and Krippa looks even tighter and isn\u2019t limited to only one agreement regarding&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>. Back in 2020, they bought the building of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel in the heart of Kyiv in Khreshchatyk Street at a high-profile auction for UAH1,111,000,000. The auction winner was&nbsp;<em>Smartlend<\/em>&nbsp;LLC registered at 130, Kyivska Street, Brovary city, in the building that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/biz.liga.net\/all\/nedvizhimost\/article\/oboshli-chernovetskogo-i-stolara-kibersportsmeny-kupili-otel-dnepr-za-11-mlrd-detali\">according to<\/a>&nbsp;<em>YouControl<\/em>&nbsp;belongs to Maksym Krippa. Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi presented this purchase to the public&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/suspilne.media\/50177-stolicnij-gotel-dnipro-planuut-peretvoriti-na-kibersportivnu-arenu\/\">saying that<\/a>, \u2018It was Ukrainian IT guys rather than Russian oligarchs that have won the auction sale of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Andrii Kholodov, a people\u2019s deputy at the time, made a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=276906090250039&amp;id=100037919509634\">statement<\/a>&nbsp;that contradicted Kokhanovskyi\u2019s words and pointed out that the purchase of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel might involve\u2026 the same old Krippa\u2019s partner \u2014 Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The auction sale of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel was likely won by Russian gambling baron Oleg Boyko (<em>Ritzio Entertainment<\/em>&nbsp;group:&nbsp;<em>Patriot<\/em>&nbsp;lottery,&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;casino,&nbsp;<em>Metro-Jackpot<\/em>&nbsp;slot machine clubs,&nbsp;<em>Khreshchatyk<\/em>&nbsp;business center,&nbsp;<em>OLBI Group<\/em>),\u2019 he wrote on his Facebook page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To confirm that, he attached the archive tax data showing that Maksym Tereshchuk, the CEO and co-owner of&nbsp;<em>Smartlend<\/em>&nbsp;LLC that had bought the hotel, was an employee of such gambling companies as&nbsp;<em>Fair Game<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>MDK<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Proryv<\/em>&nbsp;that were part of the already mentioned Oleg Boyko\u2019s Russian holding&nbsp;<em>Ritzio<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came as no surprise that Boyko surname appeared in the agreement between Krippa and Kokhanovskyi. It is obvious that UAH1,111,000,000 for buying a hotel in the center of Kyiv is too much money for a Ukrainian firm with a nominal capital of UAH11 million. And it\u2019s not that much money for a Russian gambling tycoon with an estimated fortune of $1.1 to $1.5 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, another well-known name surfaced in this story \u2013 Danylo Hetmantsev, the head of the Tax Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, whom journalist Serhii Ivanov has recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I3_PHto1wjA\">accused<\/a>&nbsp;of working for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Several firms where Maksym Krippa is an owner, namely&nbsp;<em>Profit Team<\/em>&nbsp;LLC and&nbsp;<em>Midal<\/em>LLC, are managed by CEO Oleksandr Osoka (who is also a co-founder of Maksym Krippa\u2019s&nbsp;<em>MK Foundation<\/em>Charitable Organization) whose personal phone number 09763&#8230;35 in GetContact is associated with tags&nbsp;<em>Oleksandr from Hetmantsev<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Sasha State Property Fund<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dnipro Hotel Lawyer<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danylo Hetmantsev was and, the odds are, is still engaged in gambling business. He was a stockholder of&nbsp;<em>MSL<\/em>lottery back in the days but Hetmantsev\u2019s connection with this lottery can be traced today as well: Olena Polosenko, a current co-owner of&nbsp;<em>MSL<\/em>&nbsp;is also a co-owner of Hetmantsev\u2019s legal firm&nbsp;<em>Jurimex<\/em>. Overall, the media earlier&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pravda.com.ua\/articles\/2015\/08\/17\/7077764\/\">linked<\/a>this lottery\u2019s co-founders with sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Alfa Group<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hetmantsev personally highlighted the purchase of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel in his social media. Danylo Hetmantsev, the head of the Tax Committee and former associate of FSB agent Volodymyr Sivkovych, probably assisted Krippa and Kokhanovskyi through Oleksandr Osoka in buying&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do Maksym Krippa and the Russian oligarch need a hotel in the center of the Ukrainian capital? When explaining the purpose of the agreement, Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi said that he and his partners would build the first esports hotel with an arena for hosting tournaments on the basis of&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel and that it would take only one or two years. The war may have thwarted their plans but half a year later&nbsp;<em>Dnipro Hotel<\/em>&nbsp;private joint-stock company&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epravda.com.ua\/rus\/news\/2020\/12\/16\/669226\/\">applied for<\/a>&nbsp;registering&nbsp;<em>Dnipro Casino<\/em>&nbsp;trademark specifying the economic activity classifiers of casino and night club services rather than esports. And in 2021, Krippa with Kokhanovskyi&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epravda.com.ua\/rus\/news\/2021\/04\/30\/673517\/\">submitted an application<\/a>&nbsp;to the Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries for opening a casino and slot machine halls in&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel but it was refused. Either way, the plans have evidently changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Maksym Krippa has been interested in esports for quite a while. He had entered this market long before purchasing&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel and&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;esports team. Maksym Krippa is also an owner of&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;esports bookmaker which is&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>\u2019s title sponsor and which&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/biz.liga.net\/svit-azartu\/all\/novosti\/v-ukraine-poyavilsya-novyy-legalnyy-bukmeker-i-novyy-operator-onlayn-kazino-ggbet\">obtained the license<\/a>&nbsp;from the Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries for working in Ukraine on August 23, 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget that&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;is a Russian project that was at first intended to be a bookmaker department of&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;casino.&nbsp;<em>Bet.ru&nbsp;<\/em>LLC was registered in Moscow back in 2011 and managed ggbet.ru bookmaker website in Russia. Later on, the bookmaker went international and got registered in Malta (https:\/\/ggbet.com) and Cyprus (https:\/\/gg.bet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;trademark belongs to Cyprian company&nbsp;<em>Brivio Ltd<\/em>&nbsp;that, in addition to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/gg.bet\/\">https:\/\/gg.bet<\/a>, also administers&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n Vegas<\/em>&nbsp;casino site (https:\/\/vulk@nvegas.com) under&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;trademark that, as it\u2019s been already mentioned, belongs to Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEO of<em>&nbsp;Brivio Ltd<\/em>&nbsp;is Theodor Theodoros who is at the same time the CEO of Cyprian company&nbsp;<em>One World Secretarial<\/em>&nbsp;functioning as a secretary of another Cyprian company&nbsp;<em>Bevita Holding Limited<\/em>, the founder of Russian&nbsp;<em>Bet.ru<\/em>&nbsp;LLC.

And when you make money illegally, it is dangerous to be in the public eye.&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;websites have been working outside the law in Ukraine and Russia throughout recent years. For example,&nbsp;<em>European Pravda<\/em>&nbsp;news website published&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eurointegration.com.ua\/rus\/news\/2015\/12\/16\/7042313\/\"><em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;casino advertisement<\/a>&nbsp;back in 2015 \u2013 five years before gambling was legalized in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover,&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;bookmaker successfully made and is still making money on Ukrainian players on a range of its websites not licensed in Ukraine. Licensed ggbet.ua is currently under development and doesn\u2019t work. That is, despite the fact that Maksym Krippa has received the license, he is still making money on illegal gambling without paying taxes to the budget of Ukraine just like all the previous years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, now that the \u201cblind\u201d Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries, which didn\u2019t see the Russian origin of&nbsp;<em>1xBet<\/em>&nbsp;bookmaker earlier and doesn\u2019t see the same with&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;today, has granted licenses to Krippa\u2019s gambling projects, one can become public and use billions earned on illegal gambling business to buy up companies, mass media and real estate. Which Maksym Krippa started doing without hiding that much anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the abovementioned&nbsp;<em>Dnipro<\/em>&nbsp;hotel worth over UAH1.1. billion, Maksym Krippa&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/procedure.prozorro.sale\/api\/protocol\/BSE001-UA-20230106-81261\/download\">bought<\/a>&nbsp;<em>Kniazhyi Dvir&nbsp;<\/em>hotel and restaurant complex, a place for bankers to relax and host financial events, from the National Bank of Ukraine for UAH33 million in Kniazhychi village near Kyiv in February 2023. The only bidder and eventually the winner of the auction was&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/youcontrol.com.ua\/catalog\/company_details\/42948842\/\"><em>Midal<\/em>&nbsp;LLC<\/a>&nbsp;where Maksym Krippa\u2019s share is 99.99%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having paid UAH33,111,000, he became the owner of the complex with an area of almost 1.4 hectares and premises with a total area of 3787 square meters, including a hotel, sports and health center, events hall, three conference halls, 16 summerhouses, two swimming pools and an artificial lake. According to&nbsp;<em>Glavcom<\/em>\u2019s (the publication Krippa bought through Tetiana Snopko)&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/glavcom.ua\/economics\/business\/matematika-ne-skhoditsja-bazu-vidpochinku-pid-kijevom-prodali-za-beztsin--907744.html\">estimate<\/a>, the price of $827,000 for this kind of property is much lower than the market value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A month earlier, in January 2023, Krippa\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Midal<\/em>&nbsp;LLC once again&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/dgf-procedure.prozorro.sale\/api\/protocol\/GFE001-UA-20221222-22589\/download\">purchased<\/a>&nbsp;an elite estate from previously nationalized&nbsp;<em>Prominvestbank<\/em>&nbsp;in Kozyn and Koncha-Zaspa villages near Kyiv for UAH311 million. It includes several residential buildings, and a shed, restaurant for 140 guests, administrative building, bedroom building, another residential building with an area of 1128 square meters and a few land plots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2024, Krippa <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/c\/2065328686\/10\">became the owner<\/a> of real estate in the residential complex &#171;Park Stone&#187; at the address: Kyiv, Volodymyr Ivasyuk Avenue, 2d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in December 2023, perhaps Krippa&#8217;s biggest purchase in recent times took place when he <a href=\"https:\/\/lb.ua\/society\/2023\/12\/05\/587558_kiivskiy_biznestsentr_parus.html\">bought<\/a> from Vadim Stolar the Parus business center which is the tallest building in Kyiv. On December 5, the Ola Fine company which is controlled by businessman Maksym Krippa through the Genesis investment fund became the beneficial owner of Advanced Technologies Plus LLC, which is the direct owner of the Parus shopping and office complex building on Mechnikova Street, 2 in the center of Kyiv. The amount of the transaction is unknown but one can only imagine what kind of money we are talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not surprising that immediately after Krippa became the owner of the Parus business center the GGBet bookmaker&#8217;s office appeared in this building. In May 2024, the gambling company <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/studway_ua\/795\">began publicly searching<\/a> for an office manager for its new office in Parus.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"655\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/ggbet_ofis_v_bc_parus-1024x655.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a post in the student Telegram channel STUDWAY in which GGBet is looking for an office manager for its new office in the Parus Business Center which was acquired by Maxim Krippa\" class=\"wp-image-1104\" title=\"Screenshot of a post in the student Telegram channel STUDWAY in which GGBet is looking for an office manager for its new office in the Parus Business Center which was acquired by Maxim Krippa\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/ggbet_ofis_v_bc_parus-1024x655.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/ggbet_ofis_v_bc_parus-300x192.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/ggbet_ofis_v_bc_parus-768x491.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/ggbet_ofis_v_bc_parus.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Maksym Krippa immediately opened an office of his bookmaker GGBet in the Parus business center in the center of Kyiv he bought<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"919\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-1024x919.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336\" title=\"chartproperty\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-1024x919.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-300x269.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-768x690.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-1536x1379.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/majno_eng-01-2048x1839.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><em>Chart of all Maksym Krippa\u2019s property<\/em><\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Maksym Krippa has been actively buying up businesses and real estate all this time not only in Ukraine but also in the Czech Republic. Moreover, there is an interesting coincidence \u2013 just after Tetiana Snopko had moved to this country after the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Thus, pursuant to Czech registers, in April 2022, Maksym Krippa bought Czech company&nbsp;<em>Arponi Solution<\/em>&nbsp;and renamed it to&nbsp;<em>GSC Game World Czech<\/em>&nbsp;(<em>GSC Game World&nbsp;<\/em>has developed the famous computer game&nbsp;<em>STALKER<\/em>) and became its official final beneficiary since April 7, 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 14, 2022, a new branch of&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;esports club appeared in the Czech Republic \u2013 Maksym Krippa (who hadn\u2019t become the official&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;owner yet) bought Czech company&nbsp;<em>Venroha Project<\/em>&nbsp;and changed its name to&nbsp;<em>Natus Vincere CZ<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the most noteworthy Krippa\u2019s agreement in the Czech Republic was the purchase of the villa in Troja, an elite Prague district, at&nbsp;<em>K Bohnic\u00edm 776\/1A 171 00 Praha-Troja<\/em>&nbsp;from Russian businessman Migridata Pirnazara, the former head of the board of directors of the Saint-Petersburg enterprise&nbsp;<em>Nevsky Zavod Electroshield<\/em>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ct24.ceskatelevize.cz\/domaci\/3579318-rusky-prumyslnik-se-zbavil-vily-v-prazske-troji-novy-majitel-je-spojovan-s-jinym\">According to<\/a><em>CT24<\/em>&nbsp;Czech publication, \u2018Pirnazara\u2019s family sold its share in the company for which the house was registered, and Ukrainians Maksym Khaitulov and Maksym Krippa became the new owners.\u2019 The agreement price is not mentioned but buying any real estate and business from Russians amidst the Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is quite telling.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1004\" height=\"462\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/15.png\" alt=\"Villa bought by Maksym Krippa in Prague in summer 2022\" class=\"wp-image-292\" title=\"Villa bought by Maksym Krippa in Prague in summer 2022\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/15.png 1004w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/15-300x138.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/15-768x353.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Villa bought by Maksym Krippa in Prague in summer 2022<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>As the registers evidence, the agreement took place on July 20, 2022, when Krippa and Khaitulov became the beneficiaries of Migridata Pirnazara\u2019s&nbsp;<em>RTR Co&nbsp;<\/em>trading company. It was several months after this that Tetiana Snopko came back to Ukraine and started buying up the Ukrainian media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"finalgoal\"><strong>Politics is the Final Goal?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying the media in Ukraine has always been connected with one\u2019s desire to climb to power. As it\u2019s been already mentioned, it is overall difficult to view the media in Ukraine as business projects, and even more so during the war. Yet as a tool of achieving one\u2019s business or political goals it sounds about right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The media market in Ukraine differs from others because most players are in it for political influence rather than business,\u2019 Vitalii Lapteniuk, a partner in&nbsp;<em>Flyer One Ventures<\/em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/forbes.ua\/ru\/company\/skilki-mozhe-koshtuvati-ukrainska-pravda-forbes-razom-z-investbankirami-ta-mediamenedzherom-sprobuvav-viznachiti-tsinu-portalu-28052021-1695\">stressed<\/a>&nbsp;in his comment to Forbes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking into consideration that Maksym Krippa had already tried, although unsuccessfully, to become a deputy of the Kyiv City Council from&nbsp;<em>Samopomich [Self-Reliance] Union<\/em>&nbsp;party and before that he was an assistant of Ruslan Lukianchuk and Valerii Babenko, deputies of the Verkhovna Rada 6<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;convocation from&nbsp;<em>Batkivshchyna [Fatherland]<\/em>party, the version about his intentions to get into politics may be quite realistic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The version that the media for Krippa is a way of clearing his name and, on the other hand, promoting his projects on these platforms makes sense as well. Which is already the case. For instance, delo.ua has a lot of fresh&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/delo.ua\/search\/?q=%252525D0%252525BC%252525D0%252525B0%252525D0%252525BA%252525D1%25252581%252525D0%252525B8%252525D0%252525BC%25252520%252525D0%252525BA%252525D1%25252580%252525D1%25252596%252525D0%252525BF%252525D0%252525BF%252525D0%252525B0\">publications<\/a>about Maksym Krippa\u2019s and his&nbsp;<em>\u041c\u041a Foundation<\/em>\u2019s charitable activities. Moreover, the website regularly highlights the events related to&nbsp;<em>NAVI<\/em>&nbsp;esports club and has recently published a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/delo.ua\/telecom\/nasa-velika-perevaga-v-tomu-shho-bilsist-kibersportivnogo-kontentu-produkujetsya-ukrayincyami-vitalii-volocai-maincast-413424\/\">complimentary interview<\/a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>Maincast\u2019s<\/em>&nbsp;manager Vitalii Volochai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given close ties and a rich history of relationships between Maksym Krippa and Maksym Poliakov with the Russian business, we can\u2019t exclude the potential Russian interests behind the purchase of the Ukrainian media during the war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking Maksym Krippa himself about all this turned out to be difficult as he is rarely if ever in Ukraine. Some media reported that he lives in Los Angeles but the registration data of his companies locates him in Dubai where he owns apartment No. 4803 in&nbsp;<em>Burj Khalifa<\/em>, the world\u2019s highest skyscraper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever Maksym Krippa\u2019s and his partner Maksym Poliakov\u2019s purpose of buying the Ukrainian media is, such an active development of their gambling business empire riddled with Russian roots is alarming. So is the fact that the Ukrainian State that has been fighting against the Russian aggression and paying an enormous price for it for over two years is silently watching the Russian businessmen and their Ukrainian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who funded the Russian army spread their wings in Ukraine. Although the licensing of Russian&nbsp;<em>Vulk@n<\/em>&nbsp;online casino and&nbsp;<em>GGBet<\/em>&nbsp;bookmaker by the Commission for Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call silence. It\u2019s aiding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. When preparing this material, we came to know about another purchase by Krippa-Poliakov tandem. Artem Starosek, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Molfar<\/em>&nbsp;OSINT agency, bought&nbsp;<em>AIN.UA<\/em>&nbsp;internet publication in September 2023.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/forbes.ua\/ru\/innovations\/rinok-na-desyatki-milyardiv-griven-agentsiya-molfar-robit-biznes-rozvidku-dlya-it-venchurnikh-fondiv-ta-naybagatshikh-ukraintsiv-yak-ii-vlasnik-artem-starosek-zaroblyae-na-osint-z-vitorgom-v-1-mln-11102023-16607\">According to<\/a> Forbes, before&nbsp;<em>Molfar<\/em>, Starosek worked at Maksym Poliakov\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Noosphere Ventures<\/em>&nbsp;where he did checks on the fund\u2019s investment objects.

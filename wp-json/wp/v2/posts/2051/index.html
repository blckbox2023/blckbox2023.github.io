This was the case in the 1990s with the rise of financial pyramids, the most infamous being Sergey Mavrodi\u2019s MMM. And it\u2019s happening again today, during russia\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine, with promises of quick riches through crypto trading.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleksandr Orlovskyi is currently one of the most visible crypto scammers online, luring people with stories of earning thousands of dollars a month by investing just $100.<br>But, as you might expect, in the end, he\u2019s the only one left with the money \u2014 while those who trusted him are left with nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orl1\"><strong>Who is Oleksandr Orlovskyi and How He Uses the Image of Success to Sell His Courses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleksandr Orlovskyi gained popularity through a project called <em>Financial Freedom Academy<\/em>. This &#8220;academy&#8221; presents itself as the &#8220;largest crypto community in Ukraine&#8221; and an educational platform where people supposedly learn how to invest in cryptocurrency and profit from crypto trading. Orlovskyi is promoted as the founder of the project and a crypto expert who &#8220;earned his first million dollars at the age of 24&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one <a href=\"https:\/\/usm.media\/oleksandr-orlovskii-povna-biografiya-avtora-kursiv-z-kripti-ffa\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">interview<\/a>, he claimed he was born and raised in Kyiv but moved to Poland at 16, to the small border town of Zgorzelec, after his family faced financial difficulties. He finished high school there, and at 18 moved to Wroc\u0142aw to attend university. While studying, he worked odd jobs: at a gas station, in a restaurant kitchen, and as a bartender. In most interviews, Orlovskyi shares a story about a life-changing encounter: a Polish customer named Mateusz, who turned out to be a crypto investor, introduced him to the world of cryptocurrency and became his first mentor in crypto trading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, supposedly, the talented crypto trader Oleksandr Orlovskyi was born \u2014 who now runs an aggressive PR campaign on social media, branding himself as a successful crypto investor and financial expert. &#8220;<em>At 26, I\u2019m living the life many dream of: two brand-new cars, homes in two countries, a high income, and traveling the world. But all this didn\u2019t come from luck \u2014 it\u2019s the result of the right mindset and habits<\/em>,&#8221; Orlovskyi writes on his Telegram channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He constantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/oleksandr_orlovskyi\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">posts<\/a> photos of himself in designer clothes, expensive watches, in luxury apartments, next to exclusive cars and even private helicopters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621899_gvyntokryl_oleksandr_orlovskiy-1024x447.png\" alt=\"Oleksandr Orlovskyi stepping out of a helicopter\" class=\"wp-image-1825\" title=\"Oleksandr Orlovskyi stepping out of a helicopter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621899_gvyntokryl_oleksandr_orlovskiy-1024x447.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621899_gvyntokryl_oleksandr_orlovskiy-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621899_gvyntokryl_oleksandr_orlovskiy-768x335.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621899_gvyntokryl_oleksandr_orlovskiy.png 1444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"446\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621807_avtomobili_oleksandr_orlovskyy-1024x446.png\" alt=\"Oleksandr Orlovskyi posing next to high-end luxury cars\" class=\"wp-image-1826\" title=\"Oleksandr Orlovskyi posing next to high-end luxury cars\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621807_avtomobili_oleksandr_orlovskyy-1024x446.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621807_avtomobili_oleksandr_orlovskyy-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621807_avtomobili_oleksandr_orlovskyy-768x334.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621807_avtomobili_oleksandr_orlovskyy.png 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Orlovskyi constantly posts photos with luxury cars on his social media<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He does all this to build the image of a crypto-wealth guru \u2014 someone who holds exclusive knowledge that, once purchased, will supposedly help you easily achieve a luxurious lifestyle with minimal effort. The goal is simple: to lure an average person, tired of constantly looking for ways to make ends meet, into thinking, \u201cIf he made it, so can I\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly two years now, his Financial Freedom Academy has been actively promoting and selling various types of courses, webinars, and expert consultations online. Ads for Orlovskyi&#8217;s project are everywhere \u2014 on TikTok, YouTube, Instagram. He also pays for promotional articles in national media, and influencers on social media endorse his academy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these ads, Orlovskyi\u2019s project promises that anyone who buys their courses will be able to start earning thousands, and eventually tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per month through crypto trading. They claim that over 20,000 students have already succeeded. Sounds tempting, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that the funnel for luring people into the Financial Freedom Academy is well-crafted. First, attention is captured through bold claims of quick money in viral videos. Then comes the personal \u201csuccess story\u201d of Orlovskyi himself. After that, viewers are invited to join a free webinar on how to profit from crypto trading. At the end of this webinar, the now \u201cwarmed-up\u201d audience is offered to buy the full course, get their own personal crypto consultant, and start making huge profits. \u201cIf you want to level up your life \u2014 this video is a must-watch!\u201d Orlovskyi promises in his ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1022\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo-1024x1022.png\" alt=\"Advertising for Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s crypto trading courses on social media\" class=\"wp-image-1827\" style=\"width:701px;height:auto\" title=\"Advertising for Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s crypto trading courses on social media\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo-1024x1022.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo-768x767.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621954_reklama_oleksandra_orlovskogo.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Advertising for Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s crypto trading courses on social media<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the internet is full of negative reviews from people who bought into the hype but later claimed that Financial Freedom Academy sells \u201chot air\u201d and that students are simply scammed, receiving crypto-related info scraped from free sources online. Here are a few reviews:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u00a0\u201c<em>Just another crypto scammer. Save your time and spend your money on your family instead. These courses are full of fluff and more fluff. Nothing new, just stuff you can Google for free<\/em>\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201c<em>Scammers! You pay upfront, and the contract is impossible to cancel under any circumstance. On Orlovskyi\u2019s website, it clearly states that either party can cancel within three days with no explanation, but that\u2019s not true. Cancelling is impossible. Total scam\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>\u201cThis acquaintance cost me $3,000. Not the end of the world, but definitely unpleasant.

So we decided to dig deeper into how the project really works and how much money the young man from Kyiv, now living in Warsaw, makes off of deceived Ukrainians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orl2\"><strong>Where Does the Money Collected from Financial Freedom Academy Participants Go?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to note is that there\u2019s no legal entity named \u201cFinancial Freedom Academy\u201d in any official registry. Not in Ukraine, Poland, or even Dubai, where Orlovskyi claims to live according to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/oleksandr_orlovskyi\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram<\/a>. That alone raises red flags about the legality and legitimacy of the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the FFA <a href=\"https:\/\/orlovskyi.com\/main\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>, there are seven different training programs. Six of them require a consultation with a manager, while one, called Discord 2.0, can be purchased directly, either by card or with crypto. Choosing Discord 2.0 redirects you to another <a href=\"https:\/\/orlovskyi.com\/discord-p\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> describing the program. In reality, it\u2019s just a private group chat where participants can talk with mentors, supposed experts, and even Orlovskyi himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to Discord 2.0 for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months \u2014 for $100, $180, $300, or $480 respectively. We selected the $100 crypto option. A window popped up with a QR code and a crypto wallet address. But here\u2019s the catch: every new purchase generates a new wallet address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After analyzing several of these wallets, we found they were transit wallets \u2014 they don\u2019t store funds. Instead, money flows through them and is quickly transferred to exchanges or other wallets controlled by Orlovskyi and his team. This alone looks like a classic cash-out scheme designed to obscure the origin and destination of the funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to pay by card, you\u2019re prompted to enter your payment details and complete the transaction. A screenshot shows the funds are sent to a company that applied for the \u201cFFA (Financial Freedom Academy)\u201d trademark only recently \u2014 on January 20, 2025, under application \u2116 <a href=\"https:\/\/iprop-ua.com\/tm\/uru10unh\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">m202500849<\/a> by FFA Group FZE (Dubai). There\u2019s no publicly available information about this company at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a year ago, people who paid for the courses were told in the offer agreement that payments were to be made to Orlovskyi\u2019s registered sole proprietorship (FOP). But in reality, his managers <a href=\"https:\/\/antikor.com.ua\/articles\/716348-kriptoprohodimtsu_aleksandru_orlovskomu_estj_chto_skryvatj\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">provided<\/a> bank details for an entirely different FOP. Legally, this allowed the Academy to avoid refunding payments: once the money was transferred to someone else\u2019s account, the buyer had no legal right to a refund or even to complain, since the transaction wasn\u2019t officially tied to the Academy. The same is true with crypto payments \u2014 in court, anonymous wallets carry no legal weight, and no one can prove who received the funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>One of my cohorts had 115 people. Each paid $500 \u2014 that\u2019s $57,500 from just one stream. And they run these streams one after another. They can easily have 3\u20134 cohorts per month. Payments go through different FOPs, and they constantly change them to avoid hitting limits. You can imagine how much money that is, and they pay almost no taxes<\/em>,\u201d a former student of Orlovskyi\u2019s Academy told us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"468\" height=\"792\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621980_vidguk_pro_financial_freedom_academy_3.png\" alt=\"Review of the activities of Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s Financial Freedom Academy\" class=\"wp-image-1830\" title=\"Review of the activities of Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s Financial Freedom Academy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621980_vidguk_pro_financial_freedom_academy_3.png 468w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621980_vidguk_pro_financial_freedom_academy_3-177x300.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Review of the activities of Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s Financial Freedom Academy<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/orlovskyi.com\/terms_of_use\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Use<\/a>\u201d section on Orlovskyi\u2019s website lists the following sole proprietorships (FOPs): Oleksandr Orlovskyi himself, registered on June 25, 2023, with a primary business activity listed as \u201cInformation technology consulting\u201d; his mother, Tetiana Volodymyrivna Orlovska; Lyudmyla Volodymyrivna Kolomiiets; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/iri.wolf69\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Iryna Volodymyrivna Ertel-De-Dessau<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Orlovskyi\u2019s own FOP received income only during the first two months after registration, in July and August 2023, during which he immediately received \u20b45,537,139 ($142,667). Since September 2023, his FOP has reported no official income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, his mother Tetiana Orlovska registered her FOP on August 30, 2023 \u2014 precisely when her son stopped using his own account to receive payments (likely realizing that this would help avoid refund claims). Her newly registered FOP quickly began receiving tens of thousands of dollars in revenue: in the last four months of 2023, she received \u20b44,881,748 ($130,000). In 2024, she reported another \u20b45,513,910 ($137,333) in total income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FOPs of Lyudmyla Kolomiiets and Iryna Ertel-De-Dessau, also listed on Orlovskyi\u2019s site, earned similar amounts.

This does not include the additional shell FOPs used by Orlovskyi, nor the many crypto wallets he still uses today \u2014 none of which are subject to taxation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth recalling that a year ago, the Economic Security Bureau opened a criminal case against popular blogger Oleksandr Slobozhenko, who was accused of evading over 200 million UAH in taxes by accepting payments in cryptocurrency. As we reported in earlier investigations, blogger Anna Alkhim used a similar tactic to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/anna-alhim-skilky-nesplachenyh-podatkiv-stoyat-za-prorosijskymy-vytivkamy-skandalnoyi-blogerky\/\" data-wpel-link=\"advanced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" title=\"\">hide more than $1 million in ad revenue from the state<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Kyrylo Yakovets, head of the NGO \u201cNON-STOP\u201d, Orlovskyi may have made around $4 million through his academy by exploiting the trust of about 15,000 people who gave him money hoping to learn how to earn from crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orl3\"><strong>What Assets Does Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s Family Own?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps thanks to these earnings, his 18-year-old younger brother Ivan Orlovskyi and their father Oleksandr came to own adjacent high-value land plots near the former presidential residence Mezhyhirya in the village of Novi Petrivtsi, outside Kyiv.

This information is publicly available in Ukraine\u2019s Unified Register of Court Decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to case No. 757\/26048\/22-\u0446 dated December 14, 2022, the bank demanded 102,330 UAH in unpaid principal, 7,151 UAH in interest, and 2,481 UAH in court fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Odd behavior for someone who brags about his \u201csuccess story\u201d while flaunting luxury cars and vacation photos from abroad. It makes you wonder \u2014 is the millionaire trader image just a fake?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another detail supports this theory. While digging through Telegram channels and news websites, we found a sponsored post about Orlovskyi in a Ukrainian news Telegram channel. It claimed that one of his FFA students uploaded an Orlovskyi lesson to a Silicon Valley startup platform, where it was watched by over 2,000 Americans \u2014 all of whom supposedly earned $3,000 each after testing the lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post included a photo of people watching Orlovskyi on a screen. But it turns out the image wasn\u2019t real \u2014 it was a screenshot from the TV series \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d. The image of Orlovskyi had simply been photoshopped into the scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much for the results. What\u2019s real here is just Orlovskyi\u2019s Photoshop skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"722\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621967_telegram_orkovskyy-1024x722.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a post claiming that Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s lesson was shared in Silicon Valley\n\" class=\"wp-image-1835\" title=\"Screenshot of a post claiming that Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s lesson was shared in Silicon Valley\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621967_telegram_orkovskyy-1024x722.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621967_telegram_orkovskyy-300x211.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621967_telegram_orkovskyy-768x541.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621967_telegram_orkovskyy.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Screenshot of a post claiming that Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s lesson was shared in Silicon Valley<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, the same Telegram news channel published another story about the crypto &#8220;guru&#8221;, claiming that \u201ca 23-year-old Ukrainian bought an apartment in Dubai with crypto\u201d, featuring a photo of Orlovskyi in front of a skyscraper.

Including the whole academy, where \u201cover 20,000 students earn tens of thousands of dollars a month\u201d thanks to Orlovskyi\u2019s teachings?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, about those 20,000 students. After paying $100 for the Discord 2.0 course on the academy\u2019s website, we were added to FFA\u2019s supposedly exclusive student group. It has nearly 22,000 members. But after monitoring the activity in the group, we noticed something odd: despite the massive number of members, engagement is very low. Orlovskyi\u2019s posts usually get only 200\u2013300 reactions. That\u2019s suspiciously low for a group of thousands who supposedly paid to learn how to become millionaires. So it\u2019s likely that all those \u201cstudents\u201d are fake too \u2014 just another illusion created to impress potential new victims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orl5\"><strong>How Orlovskyi\u2019s Team Helps Trusting FFA Students Lose Their Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also serious questions about Orlovskyi\u2019s team. As mentioned before, the FFA package includes not only crypto trading courses, but also \u201cpersonal mentors\u201d who are supposed to guide students on how and where to invest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of many reviews, a former student of the academy wrote: \u201c<em>Their mentors know nothing about crypto, they can\u2019t read the market, and they give advice that makes people lose their last money.

Only two use what appear to be real names \u2014 Bohdan Parnakov and Volodymyr Chupa. We identified who\u2019s behind these nicknames and what we found confirms that the criticism about their incompetence is well-founded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Maksym KobLs is Maksym Kobylianskyi, a 29-year-old former employee of the Citrus electronics store chain. Kyryll Lakerio is actually 23-year-old <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lakerio0?igsh=MW1jZzhqdTYxNHk5MA==\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Kyrylo Vorobiov<\/a> from Mariupol, who, as recently as 2022, was painting and selling artwork. In June and July of 2023, he wrote in Telegram groups that he\u2019d only been in crypto for about a year and was looking for a job in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Orlovskyi, these mentors with limited crypto trading experience try to portray themselves as wealthy and successful on social media posting photos of luxury cars and trips abroad. Yet none of them own any property or cars in Ukraine \u2014 except for Vorobiov, who still holds a flat in Mariupol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No surprise then that Orlovskyi&#8217;s fraudulent activity is now attracting the attention not just of disgruntled students, but also of law enforcement. On November 8, 2023, police in Ternopil opened criminal case <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/120819164\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\u2116120232110400002635<\/a> based on a complaint by local resident Nadiia Kovalishyn. She claimed that unknown individuals, possibly including Oleksandr Orlovskyi, scammed her out of a large sum under the pretense of investing in the \u201cCapitalProf\u201d platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iosco.org\/i-scan\/?id=35277&amp;CommercialName=FFA-Crypto-(FFA-Crypto-RISE)-(FFA-Crypto-CAPITALIST)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">according to the<\/a> International Organization of Securities Commissions, Orlovskyi\u2019s training programs, FFA Crypto, FFA Crypto RISE, and FFA Crypto Capitalist, have been blacklisted by Ukraine\u2019s National Securities and Stock Market Commission as suspicious investment schemes. Orlovskyi responded by filing a <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/125998173\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit<\/a> in Kyiv\u2019s Administrative Court, attempting to challenge the Commission\u2019s decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orl6\"><strong>How Oleksandr Orlovskyi Cooperates with Russians During the War<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In another case, <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/121686555\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\u2116991\/8911\/24<\/a>, filed by the head of NGO \u201cNON-STOP\u201d, Kyrylo Yakovets, with NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Orlovskyi is accused of running a criminal organization that scams crypto investors and allegedly doing so in coordination with the Russian platform <a href=\"https:\/\/veles.finance\/ru\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">VELES<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Yakovets\u2019 statement, Orlovskyi and his mentors recruit clients from russia, pay for ads and referral links inside russia, and process payments using russian services \u2014 effectively channeling funds into russia\u2019s economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media sources <a href=\"https:\/\/go-ns.org.ua\/article\/pokrokova-instrukcziya-yak-za-dopomogoyu-piaru-ta-bezkoshtovnyh-kursiv-zirvaty-kush-v-miljony-dolariv\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">confirm<\/a> that Orlovskyi actively promotes VELES, a russian crypto platform, through his YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bsf4nmDMtDo\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">videos<\/a> \u2014 encouraging people to register using his referral link, profiting from each sign-up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our analysis of the FFA course Discord group also found a channel called \u201cresults-crypto\u201d, where students shared screenshots of trades done specifically on VELES. In other words, Orlovskyi is funneling his students onto this russian platform, giving them no real skills, and leaving them to lose money \u2014 money that then ends up in the pockets of VELES&#8217; russian owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more concerning, all users of VELES are handing over their personal data to russia \u2014 data that could very likely be accessed by russian intelligence services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VELES is owned and operated by russian national <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vladislav.kriger\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Vladislav Kriger<\/a>. The platform, like Orlovskyi\u2019s own projects, has been flagged by Ukrainian <a href=\"https:\/\/epravda.com.ua\/rus\/finances\/nkcbfr-rasshirila-spisok-somnitelnyh-investproektov-i-finansovyh-piramid-800422\/index.amp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">regulators<\/a> as an unreliable investment scheme and may be involved in funding the russian military, according to BlackBox OSINT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This paints a deeply cynical picture in light of Orlovskyi\u2019s public claims about donating to the Ukrainian army (something he does rarely, judging by his Instagram). Given russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, his actions look not just unpatriotic, but downright treacherous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, leaked Telegram messages from July 2022 show that Orlovskyi was actively exploring investment opportunities in a <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/amazyio_ru\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">russian crypto project<\/a> called Amazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazy was developed by russian nationals, including <a href=\"https:\/\/lenta.ru\/news\/2024\/10\/14\/kosenko\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">infamous<\/a> influencer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sergey_kosenko\/?hl=ru\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Serhii Kosenko<\/a>, known for peddling crypto and self-development courses and for launching the Amazy app, a classic pyramid scheme that paid users to walk around in virtual sneakers they had to buy first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram-1024x551.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1838\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram-1024x551.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram-768x413.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram-1536x826.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/cleaned1750621909_oleksandr_orlovskyy_telegram.png 1584w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Oleksandr Orlovskyi\u2019s correspondence from summer 2022 with the authors of the russian crypto project Amazy, where he asks about the project\u2019s tokenomics (how the token is used within the project\u2019s ecosystem) and its white paper \u2014 a document outlining the project\u2019s goals, technical details, risks, and intended use, aimed at informing potential investors.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So despite russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, Orlovskyi, who makes millions off trusting Ukrainians, had no hesitation or moral barriers when it came to preparing (or possibly already collaborating) with russian crypto projects.

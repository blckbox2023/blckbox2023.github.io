When Hudz was appointed as the Director of the Municipal Property Department in 2014, he promoted his longtime colleague from the State Property Fund, Oleh Shmuliar, to First Deputy Director on April 4, 2016.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, both of them have been leasing and selling Kyiv\u2019s municipal assets together, using their influence for personal enrichment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sh2\"><strong>How Much Damage Have Andrii Hudz and Oleh Shmuliar Caused to Kyiv\u2019s Budget?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The effectiveness of their work can be evaluated through the financial reports of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv.

For example, the private funeral services company &#8220;Petro Velykyi,&#8221; owned by Alla Landar, <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/petro-velykyj-yak-alla-landar-monopolizuvavshy-rynok-rytualnyh-poslug-kyyeva-zdyraye-nadprybutky-z-rodyn-zagyblyh-vijskovyh\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">rents space<\/a> inside hospitals in the very heart of the capital for a ridiculous 59 UAH per square meter \u2014 ten times lower than the market rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone really think they\u2019re doing this out of goodwill? Unlikely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the leadership of Hudz and Shmuliar, Kyiv has been losing tens and even hundreds of millions of hryvnias in much-needed budget revenue. At the same time, according to a rough estimate based on materials from open criminal cases, their actions have caused 600 million UAH in damages to the city. For instance, Kyiv <a href=\"https:\/\/lb.ua\/society\/2021\/10\/13\/496185_direktoru_departamentu_kmda.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lost<\/a> 22 million UAH in rent revenue from the Kyiv cinema, 500,000 UAH from a rental property on Ioanna Pavla II Street, and over 1 million UAH from leasing the <a href=\"https:\/\/kyiv.gp.gov.ua\/ua\/news.html?_m=publications&amp;_t=rec&amp;id=328203&amp;fp=1640\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rybalko Market<\/a> complex. And the list goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleh Shmuliar is involved in a criminal case concerning <a href=\"https:\/\/kyivvlada.com.ua\/texts\/zlochinni-preferentsii-andriyu-gudzyu-svitit-do-5-rokiv-vyaznitsi\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">letting a tenant skip rent<\/a> at 26B Ivana Franka Street. He is also implicated in case No. 62019100000000944, initiated by the State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) on July 23, 2019, regarding the illegal acquisition of a municipal building in central Kyiv \u2014 the so-called \u201cHouse of the Author\u201d, a historic property over 100 years old, located on Bohdana Khmelnytskoho Street. The Kyiv City Administration (KCSA) sold this building at auction for 44.5 million UAH to the Vit-Plus company, owned by Vladimir Klychko, the brother of Kyiv\u2019s mayor. The sale conveniently took place immediately after the KCSA succeeded in court in <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/86329858\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lifting a freeze order<\/a> on the building, <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/83339327\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ensuring<\/a> the transaction went through before the SBI could impose a new one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shmuliar personally signed the sale agreement on September 6, 2017, through which the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv sold a 176.8 square meter non-residential building at 68\/18 Honore de Balzac Street to Garant Prof Invest LLC. At the time of purchase, only 0.23 hectares of land were officially inventoried under the building, but this data was illegally erased from the State Land Cadastre. Afterward, a new plot of land was created, covering 1.2337 hectares, with a new cadastral number and a new zoning designation for the construction and maintenance of a multi-apartment residential building with commercial and retail infrastructure. This scheme facilitated the illegal allocation of 1.23 hectares for high-rise construction in Kyiv\u2019s Desnianskyi district to a company owned by the sister of Kyiv City Council member Denys Moskal, a longtime business partner of Kyiv real estate developer Vlada Molchanova.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is just a glimpse into Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s corrupt dealings at the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv. Despite multiple criminal cases, allegations, and blatant violations in favor of private businesses, and a complete lack of meaningful results, Shmuliar \u2014 after 30 years of handling state and municipal property \u2014 still holds his position in the Kyiv City Administration. He continues to lead the theft of Kyiv\u2019s land and real estate without any obstacles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sh3\"><strong>How Oleh Shmuliar Profited Over 30 Years as an Ordinary Bureaucrat?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do the heads of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv make money? That\u2019s clear. Now, let\u2019s take a look at what Oleh Shmuliar has gained over 30 years of government service, living his entire life on a government salary. Which, by the way, remains quite modest even today. According to the department\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/gukv.gov.ua\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/%2525D0%2525A8%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B9-%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525B7%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252581-%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525B0-2024-%2525D1%252580%2525D1%252596%2525D0%2525BA.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">staffing schedule<\/a> for 2024, Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s official salary as the first deputy director of the department is 24,550 UAH. His <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/2d1e6a96-fb75-4ecc-9623-028137099c21\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023 declaration<\/a> states that his total salary from the department amounted to 719,338 UAH for the year, which comes to nearly 60,000 UAH per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shmuliar\u2019s wife, 48-year-old Kateryna Nikolaieva, is also a government employee, working at the Kyiv City Administration\u2019s municipal enterprise Kyivteploenergo, where she earned just 16,226 UAH in salary for all of 2023. Like her husband, Nikolaieva previously worked at the State Property Fund of Ukraine, later moving to the Kyiv City Employment Center, where she lost her job in 2022. She then registered there as unemployed and began receiving unemployment benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s family appears to be an ordinary household of state employees with modest public-sector incomes \u2014 barely enough to get by in the capital. And yet, somehow, starting in 2015, when Shmuliar first filed his electronic asset <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/18f3f3e0-067c-40fa-9b34-227e68959968\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">declaration<\/a> stating he had no savings at all, their cash reserves began increasing by 5,000 to 10,000 USD annually, reaching 58,000 USD <a href=\"https:\/\/public.nazk.gov.ua\/documents\/c3386e65-ddb9-4053-b3d5-d539c12de888\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">by 2022<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 30 years of government service, Oleh Shmuliar and his wife have acquired four apartments, six plots of land, a residential house, and a garage. Another residential house of unknown size in the village of Bucha, near Kyiv, is listed in his declaration as an unfinished construction project. Not bad for people who have never owned a business and have spent their entire lives on modest government salaries, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 2022, Kateryna Nikolaieva bought a garage in Kyiv for 300,000 UAH, even though she earned only 37,000 UAH that year from unemployment benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Oleh Shmuliar also bought several plots of land in the Cherkasy and Odesa regions, but he did not declare their value. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/home\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a>, a 1.19-hectare plot in the village of Yavorivka, Cherkasy region, likely cost him about 3,500 USD, while a 200-square-meter plot in the coastal village of Lyman, Odesa region, was around 5,000 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2024\\\/12\\\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1379&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:5692,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:4155,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435: A scheme showing the amount of real estate and land acquired by Oleh Shmuliar and Kateryna Nikolaieva\\n&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A scheme showing the amount of real estate and land acquired by Oleh Shmuliar and Kateryna Nikolaieva\\n&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"747\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-1024x747.png\" alt=\"A scheme showing the amount of real estate and land acquired by Oleh Shmuliar and Kateryna Nikolaieva\n\" class=\"wp-image-1379\" title=\"A scheme showing the amount of real estate and land acquired by Oleh Shmuliar and Kateryna Nikolaieva\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-1024x747.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-300x219.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-768x561.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-1536x1121.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cleaned1735309301_shmylyar-infographic-2048x1495.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: A scheme showing the amount of real estate and land acquired by Oleh Shmuliar and Kateryna Nikolaieva\n\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The assets acquired by Oleh Shmuliar, First Deputy Director of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv, and his wife, Kateryna Nikolaieva.

Their combined income for 2022 was $31,785. Yet, by the end of 2022, Shmuliar declared total savings of $58,067, which is exactly the sum of their 2021 assets plus their entire 2022 income. So, did they live an entire year on just $29? Sounds ridiculous. But it clearly points to undeclared income, as Shmuliar\u2019s declaration for that year does not mention any property sales or other legal transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sh4\"><strong>How Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s Driver, Serhii Zghurovets, Bought a $70,000 Apartment in Kyiv on a Low Salary?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s personal driver, 58-year-old Serhii Zghurovets, is also quite interesting.

However, the market value of a similar apartment in that building ranges from $68,000 USD (unfinished) to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.olx.ua\/d\/uk\/obyavlenie\/dnprovskiy-krakvska-cherngvska-1-kmnatna-z-remontom-IDVSFGe.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$110,000 USD<\/a> (renovated).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2016, Ruslana Zghurovets\u2019 annual income has averaged around $10,250 USD, while her husband, Serhii Zghurovets\u2014Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s driver\u2014earned only $4,370 USD per year. As of 2022, their total savings amounted to just 50,000 UAH ($1,370 USD). Their daughter is a student, and Ruslana&#8217;s mother is a pensioner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2022, the family&#8217;s combined income and savings totaled approximately $15,990 USD. A simple calculation makes it clear that they could not have afforded the $46,450 USD apartment they declared\u2014let alone one with a real market price of $68,000 to $110,000 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sh5\"><strong>How Tetiana Hrytsai, Chief Accountant of Kyiv\u2019s Municipal Property Department, Built a Private Cottage Community with Her Family in Stari Petrivtsi?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another interesting case involves Oleh Shmuliar\u2019s colleague, 44-year-old Tetiana Hrytsai, the chief accountant of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv.

One 0.1-hectare plot was given to Tetiana Hrytsai, another to her husband Dmytro Hrytsai, a third to Tetiana\u2019s mother, Liudmyla Lukianchuk, and the remaining two to her sister, Svitlana Stepanchuk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Tetiana Hrytsai \u2014 who, like her bosses, Andrii Hudz and Oleh Shmuliar, has held her position for years \u2014 built a 154.9-square-meter house on her land. However, just like them, she has never disclosed how much she spent on construction. Based on our estimates, a house of this size in Stari Petrivtsi would cost at least $170,000 USD, which is the average <a href=\"https:\/\/rieltor.ua\/starye-petrovtsy\/houses-sale\/view\/10669890\/?utm_campaign=external_rank_99&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=flatfy.ua&amp;utm_term=393738662\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">price<\/a> for a relatively new house in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her declarations suggest that construction began in 2017, meaning the house was built in just two years. During 2017 and 2018, the Hrytsai family\u2019s total declared income averaged $19,720 USD per year, and at the time, Tetiana Hrytsai had no declared savings. In other words, their total income over two years was just under $40,000 USD, yet they somehow managed to afford a $170,000 USD house. It seems the chief accountant of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv has her own way of doing math. No wonder she chose not to reveal the house\u2019s cost in her declarations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her sister, Svitlana Stepanchuk, isn\u2019t far behind.

Since spring 2023, this enterprise has been renamed &#8220;Kyiv Cultural Cluster&#8221; where she handled tenders and purchases. Mariia Shmuliar personally oversaw the <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2018-06-16-000069-a\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tender<\/a> for capital repairs of the &#8220;Krakiv&#8221; cinema, first awarding a 74 million UAH contract to Integral Bud-Standard LLC and later, in 2019, approving another 123 million UAH contract for <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2019-07-12-000576-a\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar work<\/a>, which was awarded to Zh.O.K. LLC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, on November 12, 2021, the Podil District Department of the National Police of Kyiv launched criminal proceedings No. 42021102070000265 under Part 3 of Article 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine \u2014 embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, or abuse of power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators found that executives of four companies, all owned by the same individual, repeatedly won public tenders for contracts awarded by the Kyiv Cultural Cluster. According to case materials, their tender victories were secured with the help of city officials\u2014in this case, Mariia Shmuliar, who was responsible for procurement. The names of the companies and their owner are redacted in court documents, but <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/en\/home\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"follow\">BlackBox OSINT<\/a> has identified Zh.O.K. LLC as one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, Kyiv Cultural Cluster transferred 112.6 million UAH to Zh.O.K. LLC for work under the original agreement. But the repairs didn\u2019t stop there \u2014 on October 11, the same municipal enterprise signed another contract with Zh.O.K. LLC, allocating an additional 34.9 million UAH for further renovations of the &#8220;Krakiv&#8221; cinema. A cinema worth its weight in gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Denys Khomych, head of the Kyiv Cultural Cluster municipal enterprise, is not only implicated in the embezzlement case involving the renovation of the &#8220;Krakiv&#8221; cinema but is also a defendant in another case for letting tenants avoid rent payments for the &#8220;Kyiv&#8221; cinema building. As mentioned earlier, the director of the Municipal Property Department of Kyiv, Andrii Hudz, and his first deputy, Oleh Shmuliar, are also involved in this case. It\u2019s all the same familiar faces in the same municipal circle \u2014 with Oleh Shmuliar on one side of the department and his daughter, Mariia Shmuliar, on the other, overseeing procurement at a municipal enterprise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariia Shmuliar didn\u2019t just work at this one municipal enterprise. In 2020-2021, she was <a href=\"https:\/\/clarity-project.info\/edr\/36927573\/history\/prozorro-sale\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">involved<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/prozorro.gov.ua\/tender\/UA-2020-04-03-001424-b?lot_id=0d9ea72d7fd24275a04273988a33c2d4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">procurement<\/a> at Kyiv\u2019s &#8220;Miskyi Mahazyn&#8221; municipal enterprise, which oversees auctions for business permits.

According to the audit report, 22 contracts were awarded to a single bidder without competition, a process directly facilitated by Mariia Shmuliar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Mariia Shmuliar works at the Ministry of Defense\u2019s municipal enterprise &#8220;Defense Procurement Agency&#8221;, overseeing tenders that, unsurprisingly, have also been linked to <a href=\"https:\/\/glavcom.ua\/country\/incidents\/proval-zakupivel-dlja-zsu-ahentsija-oboronnikh-zakupivel-ne-vikonala-kontraktiv-na-25-mlrd-hrn-1034821.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">scandals<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do we have here?

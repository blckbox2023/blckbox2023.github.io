How Bookmaker Favbet, Owned by Andrii Matiukha, Remains Present in Russia and Belarus While Avoiding Sanctions"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>One of the most popular bookmakers in Ukraine today, Favbet \u2014 owned by former Russian citizen Andrii Matiukha \u2014 has accumulated numerous grounds for criminal investigations, license revocation, and even sanctions. Despite russia\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine, Favbet has not annulled its trademarks in russia and Belarus while actively minimizing its tax obligations in Ukraine. However, while the Ukrainian authorities hold other gambling operators accountable for similar actions, the Favbet brand remains untouchable.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav1\"><strong>How the Government Cleared the Path for Favbet to Dominate the Gambling Market<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Ukrainian media <a href=\"https:\/\/kp.ua\/ua\/life\/a704225-kompanija-favbet-stala-novim-liderom-na-rinku-azartnikh-ihor-v-ukrajini-zmi\">reported<\/a> that Favbet has become the new leader in the gambling market, securing this position due to the downfall of previous market leaders \u2014 either through sanctions or criminal investigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is known, in spring 2023, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine <a href=\"https:\/\/news.liga.net\/ua\/politics\/news\/zelenskiy-vvel-v-deystvie-sanktsii-na-50-let-protiv-soten-rossiyskih-bukmekerskih-kontor\">imposed sanctions<\/a> on Parimatch, the former market leader, as well as on the Russian betting company 1xBet. A few months before that, the Commission for the Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries (KRAIL) revoked the license of FanSport, and by 2024, legal troubles had begun for three more major market players: Vbet, Cosmolot, and Pin-Up. Vbet had its accounts frozen due to <a href=\"https:\/\/reyestr.court.gov.ua\/Review\/120207569\">suspicions<\/a> of money laundering and ties to russia; Cosmolot was <a href=\"https:\/\/verdictum.ligazakon.net\/document\/116734411\">accused<\/a> of evading more than 1 billion UAH in taxes; and the nominal owner of Pin-Up was <a href=\"https:\/\/suspilne.media\/921519-zatrimali-nominalnogo-vlasnika-kazino-pin-up-u-comu-jogo-pidozruut\/\">detained<\/a> by the State Bureau of Investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This effectively cleared the way for Favbet, which now holds five KRAIL licenses to operate in Ukraine. Unlike most other gambling operators, Favbet has not faced any law enforcement actions \u2014 a fact that seems suspicious. Could it really be that Ukraine has found a gambling company that operates transparently, pays all taxes, and has no ties to russia \u2014 unlike nearly every other major player in this industry?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite. We conducted an in-depth investigation into Favbet\u2019s activities over the past few years and came to a clear conclusion: someone is protecting this gambling operator. The company has at least as many \u2014 if not more \u2014 grounds for criminal prosecution and sanctions as those that have already been stripped of their licenses in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav2\"><strong>How Favbet Operated Illegally for Two Years, Avoiding Hundreds of Millions in Budget Payments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the fact that Favbet operated illegally for two full years after the Ukrainian government legalized the gambling market in 2020. While other companies were paying tens and hundreds of millions of hryvnias in license fees and taxes from their official activities, Favbet continued to accept sports bets without a license until the end of 2022. The company&#8217;s key and most profitable license \u2014 for bookmaking \u2014 was only issued to LLC &#171;Bookmaker Company Favbet&#187; on December 28, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the company was actively operating during this period. It ran several betting platforms, including<a href=\"http:\/\/www.favbet.com\/\"> <\/a>www.favbet.com, www.favorit.com.ua, and others, while reporting no profits to the state. According to official financial reports, LLC &#171;Bookmaker Company Favbet&#187; ended 2021 with a declared loss of 31 million UAH, which increased to 40 million UAH in 2022. Yet, in 2023, when the company finally obtained its bookmaker\u2019s license, its revenue sharply increased \u2014 Favbet reported a total revenue of 9.8 billion UAH and a net profit of 1.7 billion UAH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"592\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-1024x592.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-1024x592.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-300x173.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-768x444.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-1536x888.png 1536w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148984_tov_mukmekerska_kompaniya_favbet_finansova_zvitnist-2048x1183.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Until 2023, LLC &#171;Bookmaker Company Favbet&#187; reported only losses in its financial statements.

This indicates that the company generated similar levels of revenue and profit during those years, but those numbers simply bypassed the tax authorities. And, notably, not a single law enforcement agency noticed or took action against this, allowing Favbet to secure its market dominance without the usual obstacles \u2014 such as criminal cases for illegal operations and tax evasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav3\"><strong>Nothing but Losses: How Favbet Evades Paying Profit Taxes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Favbet\u2019s bookmaking business is now legal, its other companies continue to report nothing but losses to the state.

Infographic from OpendataBot<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, isn\u2019t it odd that a company with such a dominant market share consistently reports losses in what is one of the most profitable industries today?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here\u2019s another curious detail. In 2022, all three LLCs operating under the Favbet brand across different gambling sectors reported millions in losses. Yet, the Favbet Foundation, a charity fund established by Favbet in 2020, somehow managed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/Admin45533\/favbet-copypdf\">donate<\/a> 193 million UAH to the Ukrainian state budget, the Armed Forces, and war-affected citizens in the first year of russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where did this money come from if, according to their reports, there were only losses everywhere? This suggests that Favbet is generating substantial undisclosed profits \u2014 enough to spend nearly 200 million UAH on PR-friendly donations while officially claiming financial distress. If this isn\u2019t a direct sign of operating a shadow business, then what is? These reported losses are nothing more than a tax evasion scheme, dressed up as financial misfortune.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some &#171;market leader&#187; \u2014 but only in terms of losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav4\"><strong>How Andrii Matiukha Learned to Cut Deals with the Government<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Favbet\u2019s official records show it as an almost unprofitable business \u2014 except for the sudden profits of LLC &#171;Bookmaker Company Favbet&#187; in 2023 \u2014 then the group must be making money somewhere else, through unofficial and illegal channels. Just as it did for 11 years when gambling was outlawed in Ukraine, from 2009 to 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The owner of the Favbet Group is <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/favoryt-vlady-yak-bukmeker-favbet-andriya-matyuhy-zalyshayetsya-prysutnim-v-rf-ta-bilorusi-ale-unykaye-pry-czomu-sankczij\/\">Andrii Valeriiovych Matiukha<\/a>. He founded the &#171;Favorit&#187; betting company (which was the brand\u2019s name until recently) back in 1999. In 2001, he launched a website for accepting bets, and by 2005, his network had expanded to over 90 cities in Ukraine, operating nearly 170 betting locations. By 2013, Favbet had entered Belarus, in 2016 \u2014 Romania, and by 2018 \u2014 Croatia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is well known, gambling was banned in Ukraine in 2009, but that didn\u2019t stop Andrii Matiukha from continuing to grow his now-illegal business. Like most operators in the industry, he disguised his betting sites and slot machine halls as lottery operations, which remained legal under Ukrainian law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time, law enforcement agencies caught onto Matiukha\u2019s schemes. In 2013, a criminal case <a href=\"https:\/\/zakononline.com.ua\/court-decisions\/show\/33168971\">was opened<\/a>, revealing that several companies under Matiukha\u2019s control \u2014 including LLC &#171;Dnipro-Viktoria,&#187; LLC &#171;Favorit Invest,&#187; LLC &#171;Fansportclub,&#187; LLC &#171;Modern Payment Systems,&#187; and LLC &#171;World Payment Systems&#187; \u2014 had been running illegal gambling operations for years under the cover of state lottery licenses. Later, the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office conducted searches at Favbet offices, seizing dozens of computers and other related equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, as part of criminal case No. 12016100040000990, police investigators even uncovered the money-laundering network Matiukha used to funnel bookmaking profits from &#171;Favorit Sport&#187;. Player funds were funneled into LLC &#171;Primefort&#187; and LLC &#171;Neuron Gold&#187;, then transferred to other companies under Matiukha\u2019s control \u2014 LLC &#171;Planeta Sport,&#187; LLC &#171;Sport Arena,&#187; and LLC &#171;Sfera Max.&#187; A significant portion of this money was also laundered through LLC &#171;Media Scope Global&#187; under the guise of advertising services for &#171;Favorit.&#187; According to case materials, these illegal profits were ultimately used to purchase real estate and luxury cars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, even the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on the &#171;liquidation&#187; of the Favorit betting company, stating that it was financing terrorist activities in eastern Ukraine \u2014 most likely by paying out winnings to residents of occupied Donbas territories. However, despite all these attempts, law enforcement agencies never managed to bring Andrii Matiukha to justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why was he never prosecuted? Possibly because Matiukha learned an important lesson early on: as long as you negotiate with the authorities, your business \u2014 legal or not \u2014 will remain untouched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, hackers from the international Anonymous group leaked the email inboxes of Party of Regions MPs, exposing hundreds of internal messages. Among them was an email from Andrii Matiukha, sent from favbet333@gmail.com, in which he complained to the ruling party about constant police raids on his illegal betting operations. He revealed that he was already paying $150,000 per month in bribes to law enforcement but was getting no guarantees of stable operations. His <a href=\"https:\/\/fakty.org\/andrey-matyuha-igor-sosonyuk-favbet-favbet-favorite-prodolzhayut-rabotat-s-rossiey\/\">proposal<\/a> to the government was simple \u2014 centralize the payments through the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and stop paying off local authorities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#171;<em>The total amount of monthly payments across Ukraine (to law enforcement agencies) is now about $150,000, but this does not provide any guarantees of stable operations. The company is ready to cooperate with the Ministry (of Internal Affairs) directly and cease payments at the local level. If all our betting locations in every region can operate without disruption, we are willing to increase the monthly payments to $200,000<\/em>.&#187;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems his proposal was accepted \u2014 because Matiukha\u2019s betting halls continued to operate, and he never faced trial. Just as he did back then, Matiukha appears to have mastered the art of striking deals with the authorities even today. While his competitors are being shut down, sanctioned, or prosecuted, Favbet continues to operate without interference, despite serious questions about its transparency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav5\"><strong>How Favbet Took Bets Without a License for Two Years \u2013 and Faced No Consequences<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first major question concerns Favbet\u2019s operations in 2021-2022. As we <a href=\"https:\/\/blackboxosint.com\/publichni-rozsliduvannya\/\">detailed earlier<\/a>, Andrii Matiukha deliberately avoided legalizing his bookmaking business, securing a proper license only at the end of 2022. Why? Because a bookmaker\u2019s license is the most expensive in the gambling industry \u2014 costing 108 million UAH per year.

In May 2022, Favbet issued an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100066763398485\/posts\/353197806910529\/\">official statement<\/a>, making a firm and absolute claim that the company does not operate in russia or Belarus. Moreover, Favbet even claimed that it had never operated in the russian market: &#171;<em>Throughout its entire history, Favbet has never operated in russia\u2026 Favbet not only no longer operates in russia but has never operated there in the first place. Favbet has never had offices, licenses, or payment systems for clients, and certainly never engaged in any marketing activities<\/em>.&#187;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, however, the statement also included a curious contradiction: &#171;<em>Player registration from russia is closed, and accounts of russian users that had existed on the site over the past 22 years have been blocked<\/em>.&#187; So Favbet never operated in russia, yet somehow had to block thousands of russian player accounts? Quite an inconsistency, wouldn\u2019t you say?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even a basic check of russian business registries and databases immediately raises serious questions. If Favbet never operated in russia, then why did it register its trademark in the country, with legal validity lasting until December 30, 2024? That\u2019s nearly three years into russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"359\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148958_torgivelna_marka_favbet_v_rosiyi-1024x359.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148958_torgivelna_marka_favbet_v_rosiyi-1024x359.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148958_torgivelna_marka_favbet_v_rosiyi-300x105.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148958_torgivelna_marka_favbet_v_rosiyi-768x269.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148958_torgivelna_marka_favbet_v_rosiyi.png 1216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company handling the registration of this russian trademark was LLC &#171;Bet Invest&#187;, which was founded on June 17, 2014, in moscow \u2014 right in the middle of russia\u2019s war in Donbas. The company\u2019s listed director was Tatyana Anatolievna Kotsiak, a russian citizen who, in 2015, even registered a sole proprietorship in annexed Crimea, the russian equivalent of an individual entrepreneur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Favbet trademark is still valid in russia and will remain so until March 3, 2030, since no one has revoked the rights to it. According to moscow\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/mps-patent.ru\/PoiskTorgovyhMarok\/online-poisk-tovarnogo-znaka.html\">patent office<\/a>, it was personally registered by Andrii Matiukha in March 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"427\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148952_torgivelna_marka_favbet_mijnarodna_v_rosiyi-1024x427.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148952_torgivelna_marka_favbet_mijnarodna_v_rosiyi-1024x427.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148952_torgivelna_marka_favbet_mijnarodna_v_rosiyi-300x125.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148952_torgivelna_marka_favbet_mijnarodna_v_rosiyi-768x320.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148952_torgivelna_marka_favbet_mijnarodna_v_rosiyi.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The failure to annul Favbet\u2019s russian trademark is a clear reason for sanctions against the bookmaker. After all, in spring 2023, Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council (RNBO \u2013 edit.) and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy imposed sanctions on Parimatch for precisely the same reason\u2014maintaining an active trademark in russia after the start of the full-scale war. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbc.ua\/ukr\/news\/sud-apelyatsiyi-viznav-publikatsiyu-rbk-ukrayina-1690463425.html\">reported<\/a> by RBC-Ukraine, the licensing agreements for Parimatch\u2019s brand usage in russia were formally terminated in September 2022. The Cypriot holding company &#171;Rillius Holding Limited,&#187; which owns the Parimatch\u2122 brand, claimed it had revoked its franchise agreements with russia both legally and technically in March 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parimatch later attempted to challenge this in Ukrainian courts, filing a lawsuit against RBC-Ukraine. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s Commercial Cassation Court fully <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbc.ua\/ukr\/news\/verhovniy-sud-ostatochno-pidtverdiv-pravdivist-1708074553.html\/amp\">dismissed<\/a> the case, thereby confirming that the mere existence of an active trademark in a foreign country constitutes business activity in that country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, at the same time, the Favbet trademark remained active in russia, valid until the end of 2024, yet no Ukrainian authority seemed to notice or impose sanctions. So why was Parimatch stripped of its licenses and sanctioned, while Favbet remained untouched, despite identical evidence of continued presence in russia? What makes Favbet\u2019s russian trademark any different from Parimatch\u2019s?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s go back to Favbet\u2019s claim that they never operated in russia. Are they sure about that? Even without mentioning the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/favbet.com\/\">Favbet.com<\/a> continued to accept bets from russian users and residents of occupied Ukrainian territories throughout the years of russian aggression, paying out their winnings, as evidenced by numerous online <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220603233944\/https:\/delo.ua\/ru\/business\/nicego-licnogo-tolko-biznes-kak-ukrainskii-bukmeker-favbet-ne-platit-nalogi-i-rabotaet-s-russkimi-398371\/\">reviews<\/a> from russian players about Favbet and Favorit, there\u2019s a simple question: If Favbet never operated in russia, then why register a trademark there?

However, even today, some russian registries indicate that for a long time, Andrii Valeriiovych Matiukha was officially listed as a citizen of the russian federation \u2014 right up until November 11, 2022.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already holding russian citizenship, Matiukha was assigned a russian taxpayer identification number (TIN) 770505760695, which was valid from October 11, 2001, until November 11, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Matiukha has since renounced his russian citizenship, he still holds a new russian TIN 920459743181, which remains active today.

Yet here, we have a case where the owner of an entire gambling empire was personally a russian citizen, and somehow, no one in Ukraine noticed, nor did they create any obstacles for Andrii Matiukha\u2019s business operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fav8\"><strong>How Favbet Continues to Operate in Belarus<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its May 2022 statement, Favbet claimed that as of March 1, 2022, it had completely ceased operations in Belarus, stating that all betting halls, websites, offices had been shut down, and its license had been surrendered. However, despite these claims, LLC &#171;Favbetbel&#187; is still operating in Belarus. The company registered four Favbet trademarks in Belarus, three of which remain valid until 2028 and 2029. Moreover, this same company held a Belarusian bookmaker&#8217;s license valid until February 14, 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/testibb.top\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2025\\\/01\\\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-1439&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:639px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1458,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1168,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;\\u0423\\u0432\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core\/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"820\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi-1024x820.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1439\" style=\"width:639px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi-1024x820.png 1024w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi-300x240.png 300w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi-768x615.png 768w, https:\/\/testibb.top\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/cleaned1738148965_torgivelni_marky_favbet_v_bilorusi.png 1458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"\u0423\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"context.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"context.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" \/>\n\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t<\/button><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Belarusian corporate registries, Andrii Matiukha remains a direct founder of LLC &#171;Favbetbel&#187; alongside his UK-based company Andalidi Invest LTD.

And why have Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, the RNBO, the executive branch, and the Commission for the Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries completely ignored the numerous red flags surrounding Favbet? These concerns include: tax evasion by an entire group of companies, which continuously report losses year after year; operating illegally as a bookmaker for two years without a license; maintaining active trademarks and business entities in both russia and Belarus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why has the Ukrainian government overlooked all of this when it did not hesitate to act against numerous other gambling operators?
